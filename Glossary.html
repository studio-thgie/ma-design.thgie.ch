        href="research/glossary/Actor-network%20theory.html">Actor-network
        theory</a> (ANT)</h2>
        <p>Actor-network theory treats non-human objects and things,
        such as doorknobs, keys, tables, the weather, electricity,
        ferns, sandwiches, cockroaches, bookcovers, elevator buttons,
        port standards, APIs and others as actants within socio-material
        networks.</p>
        <h2 id="application-programming-interface-api"><a
        href="research/glossary/Application%20Programming%20Interface.html">Application
        Programming Interface</a> (API)</h2>
        <p>An API is a standardized way in which two pieces of software
        can interact with each other. APIs become very relevant within
        the context of assistive technologies. They offer the chance to
        access a piece of software in ways the original developers and
        designers didn’t forsee.</p>
        <h2 id="assistive-technology-at"><a
        href="research/glossary/Assistive%20Technology.html">Assistive
        Technology</a> (AT)</h2>
        <p>ATs are products, equipment, and systems that enhance
        learning, working, and daily living for persons with
        disabilities.</p>
        <h2 id="emotional-durable-design-edd"><a
        href="research/glossary/Emotional%20durable%20design.html">Emotional
        durable design</a> (EDD)</h2>
        <p>Emotionally durable design is interested in our relations to
        products and forming strong bonds with them.</p>
        <h2 id="gafa">GAFA</h2>
        <p>Abbreviation for Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple.</p>
        <h2 id="human-computer-interaction-hci"><a
        href="research/glossary/Human-Computer%20Interaction.html">Human-Computer
        Interaction</a> (HCI)</h2>
        <p>HCI focuses on the interfaces between people (users) and
        computers. HCI researchers observe the ways humans interact with
        computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact
        with computers in novel ways.</p>
        <h2 id="new-materialism"><a
        href="research/glossary/New%20Materialism.html">New
        Materialism</a></h2>
        <p>A assemblage of theoretical approaches to flatten her
        ontological hierarchy between humans and non-humans. New
        materialism is closely related to the ontological and material
        turns in critical theory.</p>
        <h2 id="ontological-design"><a
        href="research/glossary/Ontological%20design.html">Ontological
        design</a></h2>
        <p>Derived from the philosophy of Heidegger, ontological design
        essentially is saying that what we design designs us back.
        Ontological design was brought forward in design theory by
        Anne-Marie Willis and taken up amongst others by Design Justice
        and Arturo Escobar.</p>
        <h2 id="postphenomenology"><a
        href="research/glossary/Postphenomenology.html">Postphenomenology</a></h2>
        <p>The study of technology in terms of the relations between
        human beings and technological artifacts, focusing on the
        various ways in which technologies help to shape relations
        between human beings and the world.</p>

        <h2 id="user-centered-design-ucd"><a
        href="research/glossary/User-centered%20design.html">User-centered
        design</a> (UCD)</h2>
        <p>User-centered design is a design approach that places users’
        needs, wants, and desires at the center of the design process.
        It ensures that these needs and desires drive the development of
        a product, system, or service.</p>
        <h2 id="universal-design-ud"><a
        href="research/glossary/Universal%20design.html">Universal
        design</a> (UD)</h2>
        <p>Universal design was driven through processes in liberal
        political, economic, and scientific structures concerned with
        defining the disabled user and designing for them. UD is
        designing for the most diverse range of users possible without
        falling back to a one-size-fit-all approach.</p>
        <h2 id="utterance"><a
        href="research/glossary/Utterance.html">Utterance</a></h2>
        <p>Utterances in the context of a voice assistant are short
        commands that the VA then can match against patterns to
        recognize the intent of the user.</p>
        <h2 id="voice-assistant-va"><a
        href="research/glossary/Voice%20Assistant.html">Voice
        Assistant</a> (VA)</h2>
        <p>Voice assistants are technologies that create a dialogical,
        spoken interface with computational ressources. Input can be
        made in the form of a command (utterances) and the output is
        spoken back by the device or software.</p>
        <h2 id="voice-assistant-skills">Voice assistant Skills</h2>
        <p>Skills are encapsulated functions for a voice assistant
        platform, such as asking for the weather or setting a timer.
        Skills are akin to micro-applications that are installable on a
        voice assistant like Amazon Echo or the open-source Mycroft.</p>
        <h2 id="voice-user-interface-vui">Voice User Interface
        (VUI)</h2>
        <p>VUI makes it possible for users to interact with a device or
        an app through voice. Input and ouput are created through audio
        only. VUIs are part of voice assistants but also operating
        systems such as MacOS or Windows or softwares such as Dragon
        NaturallySpeak.</p>
