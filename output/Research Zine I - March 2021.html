        <h1 id="research-zine-i---march-2021">Research Zine I - March
        2021</h1>
        <p>This research zine captures the intermittent results from a
        first round of gathering and analysing data. The goal of this
        zine is to create access to said data, in a less rigorously
        scientific manner. I’d love for you to see this a snapshot, as
        well as a working tool. It’s not meant to stay untouched. Take
        notes on it, mark what you find interesting, scribble and
        sketch. The texts are not meant to be read in a linear way. Just
        jump in where your attention takes you. It’s a process and
        you’re now part of it.</p>
        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>A core subject of this research project is the application of
        animism in the design of technological artifacts. So I probably
        need to elaborate a bit on that.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="output/What%20is%20animism,%20anyways.html">What is
        animism, anyways</a></li>

        Emotionally Durable Design</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="thematic-analysis">Thematic Analysis</h3>
        <p>Thematic analysis is an approach to work with qualitative
        data. In it, you label pieces of data that you find interesting,
        help to answer questions or stand out with codes. In a second
        phase, you try to find themes that summarize the codes. I
        followed a reflexive approach after Brown &amp; Clark. All the
        data that lead to this analysis can be access on the digital
        archive. The main methods involved in the gathering were
        interviews, observations, user journey mappings as well as
        online research.</p>
        <p>In the analysis I concentrated on those parts, that were not
        so positive. They interested me because they offer potential for
        change.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="output/themes/What%20is%20a%20voice%20assistant.html">What

        <h3 id="visuals">Visuals</h3>
        <p>What I saw in the field was a stark contrast to what the
        advertisements sell. Quite another impression leaves the many
        ways of customizations for voice assistants that can be found
        online.</p>
