        <p>In the last few month I got to know many different sides of
        animism. All a bit different, but somehow related.</p>
        <p>Animism is a concept that originated in anthropology and was
        used to describe the beliefs of some indigenous communities and
        people. Animists believe that other-that-human things like
        rocks, plants, or even rivers have a spirit residing in them. On
        the other hand, in psychology, animism means that something is
        perceived as animated, or alive. This is best described in the
        different stages of animism in children, in the studies of
        Piaget. A third approach, which is heavily inspired by both
        these areas, is found in the post-structuralist thought of Felix
        Guattari and the scholars building on that work.</p>
        <p>There are links and relations between these three fields,
        although at this moment rather intuited than scientifically
        proven. There is animism that stems from experience or
        perception, and another that stems from knowledge or belief.
        Both path lead to a changed interaction with or treatment of the
        thing in question. That doesn’t always have to be a positive
        thing, but in a best case scenario it’s the base for a new
        ethics. The Māori people that live along the Whanganui river,
        for example, fought for decades that this river is getting the
        legal status of a person. This river now has fundamentally
        different rights with huge implications for environmental
        protection.</p>
        <p>I use animism as a continuation of the process of developing
        ethics that we as Central-European and white people started with
        animal rights. A mere 150 years ago, we still argued that
        animals are soul-less and can be treated like machines. That not
        only animals but also plants and other-than-human things like
        the weather or rivers is a long-established fact in many
        indigenous epistemologies. What we have to do know, is to
        unsettle our beliefs in which we impoverish everything
        other-than-human of the same ethical considerations as we give
        ourselves.</p>
        <p>Animism is the acknowledgment and the perception that we’re
        neither in the center nor alone in this reality. The best
        expression we have for the other-than-human subjects is the
        ascribing of a common base, for example, that we all have a
        soul, contain spirits, or have some kind of consciousness.
        Animism is also the practice and aesthetics of such a
        world-making project.</p>
        <p>That sounds pretty abstract, doesn’t it? Have you ever talked
        to one of your houseplants? You could consider that as an
        animism practice. Did you ever caringly caress your smartphone
        after you let it fall? Animism. Do you have a unique ritual for
        an old kitchen device, without it wouldn’t work? Probably
        animism, I would argue. Through and with animism, we elevate
        pasive things to alive things, even if they don’t move or are
        biological beings (although that makes things much easier).</p>
        <p>The problem we have, as a Central-European culture, is that
        we don’t have a way to express animism. We need to change that.
        We need to find ways, to unsettle our over-rational ways of
        going about our businesses and need to develop ways of
        expressing our relationship that we have with the things we
        surround ourselves. This is the core aspect of this research
        project. To develop the knowledge on how to create things out of
        such a mindset.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Can animistic views and practices be found in approaches in
        our society, even if it can no longer show any animistic
        tradition? Can animistic practices in design lead to a more
        intensive connection to technological products and processes?
        What are the effects of such a relationship?</p>
