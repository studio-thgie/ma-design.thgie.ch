        <p>Dec 15, 2019</p>
        <p>Have you ever tried to repair your own mobile phone? Why
        not?</p>
        <p>With this document I intend to lay the basis for further
        inquiries regarding my master thesis as well as the development
        of a use case. I started out with the premise that a respectful
        and caring relationship to our companion objects can help
        lifting the ecological burden on the planet as well as the
        socio-economic exploitation of a precarious workforce. That
        said, I have the hypothesis that there is a time of care for
        things, between receipt and the loss of it. This care is driven
        by the fear of loss as well as an affection for the object in
        question.</p>
        <p>The use case I want to look at specifically is the commonly
        used mobile phone. Its smartness doesn’t play much of a role,
        since I want to concentrate on the material manifestation of
        this everyday object. The difference in used raw material for
        either variant is miniscule. In its physical form, dumb and
        smart phones do not differ much.</p>
        <p>There are estimated 6 billion active mobile users worldwide.
        1.5 billion mobile phones were sold in 2018. Theses phones are
        obviously not only integral to people’s lives but also have an
        undeniable impact on the planet as well as the exploited
        workforce in terms of extraction of raw materials, production
        and recycling. Fairphone as well as others well researched the
        impact the production and recycling of mobile phones have on the
        ecology. Most waste is generated at the level of extraction of
        raw materials as well as production of the actual device. That
        means, that the “most sustainable phone is the one you already
        own” (Fairphone, 2019). No new device, even the ones from
        Fairphone, are more sustainable, then keeping an existing device
        for as long as possible.</p>
        <p>Design has an important role to play regarding the mobile
        phone as a commodity fetish. Early phones where highly eclectic
        devices. Since all phones basically drew from the same set of
        functionalities – that is phoning, texting, agenda and the
        occasionally game – style was important as a differentiating
        factor. These phones from the zero years came in all kinds of
        shapes and colors and often with the possibility to attach
        customized items directly to the phone. In a second wave, phone
        companies tried to attract new customers with highly specialized
        functionalities, like Nokia’s N-Gage, a phone concepted as a
        gaming device. The third and current wave, began with the advent
        of Apple’s iPhone. Initially heralded a milestone of industrial
        design, it quickly became the quasi standard of how a smartphone
        has to look like. The focus is on the screen, in which all of
        the phone’s importance lie. Today’s smartphones are impersonal
        at best, trying hard not to be in the way of screen interaction.
        These phones are deliberately designed this way, to make them
        easily replaceable.</p>
        <p>What eventually happened is, that capitalist logic removed
        all friction in producing and removing mobile phones from our
        life and externalize the damage done to the less fortunate. What
        I want to formulate is a practice of care for mobile phones that
        counteracts the logic of capitalism. Following the collective
        Precarias a la Deriva, as well as other feminist activists and
        scholars, the usage of the term care in the context of acting
        against capitalism is not without problems. Care work is and was
        done mainly by women and without financial benefits to the
        care-worker. This has to be considered.</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon, that craftspeople get into affectionate
        bonding with the tools of their trade as well as the things they
        produce. Such relationships are not limited to craftspeople, but
        can also be transmitted on a societal level through culture, as
        practices like the broken needle festival Hari-Kuyō in Japan
        show. Also, there always have been practices of care by the
        underprivileged for their belongings, out of sheer
        necessity.</p>
        <p>I’m generally interested in caring and respectful
        relationships with the objects that we surround ourselves in
        everyday life. But, practices and the knowledge of care are
        highly situated, which means there isn’t simply a universal
        theory to apply. Care practices draw from diverse influences in
        feminist and intersectional activism and theory. To develop a
        practice of care means to reference these works and take them
        seriously. A practice of care needs to be developed and grown
        within its applied context.</p>
        <p>But before we can get into that we must ask, what is the
        relationship to our mobile phones? This is a necessary first
        step for a deeper understanding of our relationship to this
        modern companion objects. It is also a necessary first step for
        discovering possible entry points for care practices.
        Relationship in this context means the thinking about, feeling
        about and interaction with mobile phones.</p>
        <p>Und jetzt?</p>
        <h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
        <p>The approach I’m tracing in this document is partially rooted
        in my own experience.</p>
        <p>My mother studied ceramics and she had her workshop in our
        home. I grew up with her lived experience as a craftsperson and
        through her practice she thought me the beauty of everyday
        objects. I learned how they should be treated with respect and
        even affection.</p>
        <p>Two other cornerstones of my life dealt with electronic
        waste.</p>
        <p>I worked in e-waste recycling for quite a while, through a
        program in social support. I was in a different headspace back
        then and the activity was very welcomed by me. The physical
        labor, involving a lot of axe work, is arduous. The main goal of
        e-waste recycling is, to separate the valuable part from the
        unimportant ones. During that time, I got to know a lot of
        devices from the inside. It made me acutely aware of materiality
        of electronic devices as well as the processes involved in
        taking them apart.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, was I welcomed into a research project
        that dealt with electronic waste on a global scale, aptly named
        Times of Waste. We used a “follow-the-thing” approach to trace a
        smartphone’s becoming, starting from the extraction of raw
        materials, until its demise, the recycling part. What struck me
        most, during the research project, was the incredible entangled
        mess, that makes up a smartphone. The distributed global mesh of
        extraction, production, use and recycling is simply wondrous and
        almost beyond believe, that something like this can come into
        existence and maintain its presence.</p>
