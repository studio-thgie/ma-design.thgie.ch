        <p>I was able to present my project at the NERD conference. The
        format is half an hour presentation and half an hour discussion,
        which led to many valuable insights, most of all a validation
        for the project.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>With a great understanding of the ubiquitous design of all
        aspects of everyday life, research in design reveals an
        astonishing competence to discuss economic, social, ecological
        and medial processes of the present. In doing so, such design
        research, if wisely implemented, offers a fundamental critique
        of design as well as a variety of possible perspectives to
        better understand the present and prospects for the future.</p>

        <p><em>Application for NERD 2021, Adrian Demleitner</em></p>
        <p>Do you believe that things can have a soul, or contain a
        spirit for that matter? If yes, you are not alone. Looking at
        the different cultures of this world, one notes the Eurocentric
        perception of things as passive or dead material is the
        exception. Summarized as animism it is defined as the elevation
        of material things to other-than-human subjects. Either way,
        taken as literal ontological truth or as a metaphor for the
        aesthetic surplus of grand design, this research is based on the
        hypothesis that an animistic point of view can change the
        interaction and relationship we have to an object.</p>
        <p>Consumer electronics became steady companions in our life.
        Not only do we interact with them regularly, but they are also
        with and close to us throughout the day. We could call them
        companion objects, following Donna Haraway’s concept of
        companion species — electronics and people, who are bonded in
        significant otherness. This notion is furthered by ontological
        design, which states that we’re not just users of products, but
        that the products actively make us who and what we are. Even if
        we’re not aware of this process.</p>
        <p>Despite continuous innovation, consumer electronics also
        became mass-produced devices, that can’t hold meaning for a
        longer time. We enjoy them for a short time after the
        acquisition and during a brief moment, we can have a rendezvous
        with the ephemeral spirit of innovation and technological
        superiority. Yet, we can neither truly relate with the acquired
        technologies, nor can they evolve with us and our progressing of
        our life. Soon, the little meaning they held for us vanishes,
        and the devices, although practically functioning, become
        disposable. They will be getting rid of as soon as we see a
        reason to do so. We essentially become alienated from these
        devices. One of the most direct consequences of this alienation
        is that we consume technology in rapid turnovers, producing more
        electronic waste than we can recycle. Knowledge emerged in the
        last decade, that the mining of raw material for electronics as
        well as the production of these devices can harm the environment
        as well encourage the exploitation of the workforce.</p>
        <p>Designers have repeatedly tried to change people’s
        consumption to address these problems. Be it through quality
        (Gute Form), DIY (Whole Earth Catalog, Papanek), deceleration
        (Slow Movement), new design approaches (Transition Design,
        Circular Design), or humanistic ideals (Human-Centered Design).
        Contemporary technology consumption seems to elude these
        discourses. Except for a few products (Fairphone) or practices
        (Low- or ethical tech, the Closing-Worlds Initiative), the
        problematics of contemporary technologies are ignored. Until
        today, design theories often understand design as a
        problem-solving approach, reproducing a modern narrative that
        disregards the plurality of the world. The criticism and
        introduction of new ways of thinking into the design discourse
        thus also raises the question of the topicality and relevance of
        modern dogmas in the design of technological processes and
        products.</p>
        <p>Believing that things have a soul can make us bond with them
        respectfully. By focusing on this intersection of emotionally
        durable design, our relationship to consumer electronics and
        animism, this research addresses the following questions: How
        can animism support the development of emotionally durable
        design?</p>
        <p>In this two-parted presentation, I will go into the interim
        results of the project as well as the overall project
        architecture. After the literature review and an ethnographic
        sampling, especially the thematic analysis of the gathered data
        as well as the prototyping phase is of interest for design
        research. The second part of the presentation will outline how
        the project structure will try to answer inquiries into
        epistemological matters.</p>
        <p>My interest in other-than-human subjects is rooted in my
        profession as a software engineer and the recognition of
        actor-network-theory as a fundamental change of what we consider
        having agency. As such, I have been working with artificial
        intelligence, bots, and digital artifacts as actors but also
        with the multispecies discourse. However, as a Master’s student
        in Design Research and my background as growing up surrounded by
        art and craft, I am also deeply entangled with design and its
        material aspects. This conjuncture builds the base on which the
        intention for this project grew. Specifically, it is an attempt
        to bring aspects that make up a rich life to a field, which is
        mainly concerned with innovation and functionality. The
        potentials and interests of design include subjective
        experience, generating and embedding meaning within things, and
        of course emotions. These potentials need to be brought to the
        design of technological artifacts.</p>
        <p>The research project is aimed at tracking and describing
        existing animistic aspects and practices as well as entry points
        in a user’s journey with technological devices. The development
        of these aspects, “weak signals”, into prototypical narratives
        will take place in a second phase within participatory
        workshops. The aim is to develop manifested narratives,
        prototypes, around an already existing technology, which can
        then be tested.</p>
        <p>In the first phase of the project, I focus on the voice
        assistant devices Amazon Echo and Google Nest Mini.
        Specifically, I will use ethnographic sampling and data
        collection to learn more about the specific role and meaning it
        has for their owners, respectively the household they are placed
        in. This data and the subsequent thematic analysis are treated
        as weak signals. Weak signals can be found in the already
        existing daily routines and stories of the interviewed and
        observed participants. The detection of weak signals is based on
        ethnographic research with the methods of observation,
        interviews as well as user journeys, narrative inquiry, and
        experience reports. The collected data is worked on through
        thematic analysis with a reflexive approach after Brown and
        Clarke. The developed codes and themes serve as input for the
        second phase.</p>
        <p>The second phase will explore the potential of design to
        develop other ways of interacting with technology. Prototypes
        will be developed in a series of interdisciplinary and
        participatory workshops together with experts from different
        design disciplines (industrial- and product design, graphics,
        service design) as well as professionals focused on writing or
        craft. These prototypes should apply to already existing
        technologies, in this case, voice assistant devices. The
        workshops focus on the user and the device, the interaction
        between them as well as the generated meaning out of this
        relation. The prototypical narratives can contain elements of
        storytelling, ritual, aesthetic add-ons, or complete reshaping
        of the device itself. The process of the workshop is guided by
        theoretical inputs on animism as well as the weak signals
        generated in the first phase.</p>
        <p>To summarize, the project aims to understand animism from an
        epistemological point of view and its application in the design
        of technological devices. Animism then is the consideration of a
        thing as something with an agency, even if it is not physically
        animated, respectively physically acting. Simply by existing, a
        thing has an impact on the world. That is, even more, the case
        with the electronics that we surround ourselves with. This
        approached is backed by emotionally durable design, which
        demands, among other things, the design of consciousness into
        products. Animism, the idea of a thing having a soul, can be
        taken on par with this demand. At least, epistemological
        speaking. There are many questions involved regarding this
        approach, many of which can’t be tackled through this project
        alone. The main guiding question therefore will be: How can
        animism support the development of emotionally durable
        design?</p>
        <p>The project aims to produce knowledge for the domain of
        design, from which a few disciplines and fields could profit.
        These include industrial and product design, disciplines
        involving storytelling like marketing or event design as well as
        fields concerning the environment like transition or circulatory
        design. Beyond the scope of this project, further questions can
        be asked. Can an animistic point of view prolong and intensify
        the emotional bond we have with technological products and
        processes? What are the epistemic effects on the users of
        animistic narratives in design? Can animism be introduced to
        non-animistic communities? Can design tackle such a
        challenge?</p>
