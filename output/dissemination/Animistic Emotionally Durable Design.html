        Emotionally Durable Design</h1>
        <p>In my research I found two approaches who fit very well
        together. On is about the exploration of animism in digital
        technology and the other one is about designing things to which
        we can have meaningful relationships.</p>
        <p>This project, or my work here, is not the first and probably
        not the last approach to bringing animism and design together.
        Most notably are the theoretical works of Brenda Laurel and
        Betti Marenko who put much thought into this. They have a very
        specific approach, coming from critical theory and going towards
        new materialism. New materialism thinks about matter as more
        than just passive stuff and instead perceives it as a complex
        and highly active other-than-human element. On the other end, I
        found Jonathan Chapman’s work on emotionally durable design very
        powerful. The core message is that trash is just a failed
        relationship between us and the things we discard.</p>
        <p>There is a subtle link between the theoretical approach of
        Marenko. the practical approach of Chapman and my intentions. I
        want us to live in a world, where we perceive the things we
        surround ourselves with as complex and beautiful actants that
        co-create our lives as we do their existence. That needs change
        to happen in two areas; We need to learn to perceive the world
        and the things it contains as such and we need to be able to
        express that.</p>
        <p>What follows are two categorizations from the two different
        approaches. I find them interesting and inspiring when I try to
        think about animistic design.</p>
        <h2 id="betti-marenkos-neo-animism">Betti Marenko’s
        Neo-Animism</h2>
        <p><strong>Agency</strong> “Rather than considering only
        subjects as active, and objects as passive, animistic design
        explicitly considers objects on an equal stand with subjects, as
        all agents that ‘do’ things. Agency is not something that
        objects a priori have; it is not an innate property. Agency is
        conceptualized as a relational concept instead, as being
        actualized, embodied in the relationship between the object and
        the broader ecology in which it is interacting.” (Zaman et al.,
        2018)</p>
        <p><strong>Embodiment</strong> “Embodiment is critical to the
        animistic design approach because it creates a physical milieu
        for a person to use their spatial perception to organize ideas
        from each actant, tangibly manipulate the actants and what they
        represent, and participate as a social actor with the actants.”
        (Marenko &amp; van Allen, 2016)</p>
        <p><strong>Ecology</strong> “An animistic design perspective
        challenges interaction designers to design for an expressiveness
        of animated objects with intent, while positioning them in a
        wide ecology of human-object entanglements.” (Zaman et al.,
        2018)</p>
        <p><strong>Uncertainty</strong> “Instead of aspiring control and
        creating pre-defined, predictable human-computer interactions,
        animistic design embraces the uncertainty that emerges when
        various agents creatively engage in and co-create different
        realities.” (Zaman et al., 2018)</p>
        <h2 id="emotionally-durable-design">Emotionally Durable
        Design</h2>
        <p><strong>Relationships</strong> How can we build a
        relationship that is emotionally rich and engaging between
        products and users?</p>
        <p><strong>Narratives</strong> How can we build and capture
        narratives that exist between products and users?</p>
        <p><strong>Identity</strong> How does the identity of the
        product and the user coexist within the interaction journey?</p>
        <p><strong>Imagination</strong> How can we build imagination
        delight, intrigue, engagement within the product interaction
        journey?</p>
        <p><strong>Conversations</strong> How can we create
        conversations between products and users?</p>
        <p><strong>Consciousness</strong> How can we create a sense of
        consciousness within the product interaction journey?</p>
        <p><strong>Integrity</strong> How can we build integrity both
        the physical integrity and emotional quality into the
        product?</p>
        <p><strong>Materiality</strong> How does the materiality of the
        product develop and change over time through use?</p>
        <p><strong>Evolvability</strong> How can the product evolve with
        the user?</p>
        <p>These are directly taken from the Emotional Durability Design
        Nine, a framework to think about how to create healthier
        user-product bonds. (Haines-Gadd et al., 2018)</p>
        <h2 id="why-do-we-need-something-like-that">Why do we need
        something like that?</h2>
        <p>Animism involves interaction with other-than-human things
        treating them as quasi subjects.</p>
        <p>I hope and I hypothesize that an animistic approach can have
        two effects. The first one is very practical. If an animistic
        design can forge stronger bonds between user and product,
        leading to longer usage times, there will be less turnover. In
        the case of electronics that means less unrecyclable trash and
        fewer mining observations, which is good for the environment.
        The second effect is highly utopian. It is about imagining
        another relationship to technology. The way we interact with
        tech is mainly designed by the companies we get the technology
        from. But as I’ll show in my analysis, it’s not always in our
        nor in the planet’s best interest. I want us to have a
        relationship to technology as we can have with plants or pets.
        Respectful, caring, knowing that they form us as we form them. I
        hope that an animistic design approach can lead in that
        direction.</p>

        <p>What practical knowledge do designers need to enable them to

        thus strengthening the emotional bond, leading to longer product
