        <h1 id="what-is-a-voice-assistant">What is a voice
        assistant</h1>
        <p>This theme explores questions around what such an assistant
        is, can be or is perceived as. Voice assistants, especially
        those within a stationary device, are a relatively new
        technology. As such they don’t have a very well established use
        case and the users are often not very sure what it actually
        is.</p>
        <p>In my research, I differentiate between the device, which
        contains the electronics and the hardware, and the assistant,
        which is the software part, the person residing inside the
        device.</p>
        <p>Before everything else; The sexist approach to voice
        assistants is highly problematic, to say the least. The first
        choice for the assistants’ voices was female. That says a lot
        more about this thing than the tech companies intended. Lately
        Google added different gendered voices and makes the initial
        choice random. But this deep-running problem in the tech
        industry made its way into the assistant as well.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Like with a stupid dog that doesn’t want to hear what I say.
        Sometimes it’s cool when it does, and then you think wow great,
        he did it! Good, good Alexa. And otherwise, I often just say
        “Alexa, you whore”. Just like that, just for a little bit, ah
        you stupid thing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I don’t know where and when this dream of a personal
        assistant arose, but I guess it is intricately linked to
        advertisement and the advent of a middle class, which wishes of
        feeling further above in the social hierarchy got triggered by
        said ads. The voice assistant caters to an unsharp end, but
        according to the ads, it must involve having a simpler life.
        Shades of pastel, symbols of the creative class, or slogans of
        automated, optimized lives accompany the storytelling around the
        voice assistants.</p>
        <p>The people I interviewed were often just curious to explore
        the possibilities. Only few go so far as to automate parts of
        the home. They got hooked by this reality turned scifi
        technology that many of us got to know from popular culture.</p>
        <p>But what is then in the end, this assistant? There are more
        questions than answers to this. Is it entertainment? It is
        probably for those who use the assistant just for music. Is it a
        work-related item? Probably not, but optimizing your life,
        automating your environment, and offloading mental tasks surely
        sound like it comes for the world of work. The assistant can do
        almost everything a computer can do as well. In the end, it’s
        mostly an interface to the gigantic infrastructures of the tech
        companies, but those <a
        href="output/themes/Questions%20of%20scale.html">Questions of
        scale</a> are lost within the daily interaction with the user.
        They rather just use it to listen to music.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>For me is so, somehow, I do not want entertainment. I want
        technology that… an iPad is not entertainment for me. It’s a
        tool for me to work with and to do. Yeah, even VR glasses are
        not just, just entertainment. It’s kind of trying new things and
        not just entertainment. It’s way too passive then.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The <a
        href="output/themes/Communication,%20Language%20and%20Behavior.html">Communication,
        Language and Behavior</a> involved with the assistant is very
        close to the uncanny valley. Now and then, the assistant is
        weird, spooky, and sometimes right out creepy - starting to
        speak or laugh without former interaction, setting alarms in the
        night, or playing unstoppable music. The assistant is always
        present, listening in, ready to act. This presence hooks into
        our subconsciousness and if there was no interaction for a
        while, we need to check-in.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>After a while of inactivity and not using the voice
        assistant: “Hey Google, are you still alive?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The assistant promises a human form of communication to our
        electro-digital environment. Some users anthropomorphize the
        assistant, but never as an adult. Many more users are othering
        the assistant. They act in master-slave patterns, see in it a
        stupid dog, or even worse, throw sexist insults at it while
        kicking it. What was meant as a companion, to make life easier,
        brings out the worst in us? It promised to enable natural
        human-computer communication, but it’s all fake. We’re not
        getting anything human out of this, no matter how angry we
        get.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>What are the stories underlying the design and use of
        technological artifacts? What are the values conveyed in these
        stories? Are there alternatives to these stories?</p>
