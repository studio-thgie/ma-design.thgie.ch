        <p>There is a psychological effect in which the more a thing is
        recognized as being human the more trustworthy or relatable it
        is. There is a brief gap of cognitive dissonance when we can’t
        decide anymore if something is human or not. This gap is the
        uncanny valley and we generally don’t trust things if they are
        to be placed in there.</p>

        <p>The uncanny valley finds many expressions in the interaction
        with voice assistants. First, we have <strong>uncanny
        communication</strong> by encountering human voices but robotic
        speech patterns. The voices of current implements are near
        perfect, indistinguishable from real humans, but the way they
        communicate is robotic or scripted.</p>
        <p>Another problem that is often encountered is that the devices
        go off without users intending them to do so; <strong>activation
        without interaction</strong>. I have more than one funny and
        sometimes downwards creepy anecdote to tell around this. These
        seemingly random activations are often not perceived as quirky,
        like with a pet, but alienating.</p>
        <p>The last issue is that the voice assistants build up a
        <strong>ghostly presence</strong>. This perception arises from
        the fact, that voice assistants are always-on devices. They are
        always listening in on their environment, waiting for a wake
        word, upon hearing it being unlocked and available for further
        interaction. Knowing this made my participants feel a presence
        in the room that led them to alter their behaviors and how and
        what they said.</p>
