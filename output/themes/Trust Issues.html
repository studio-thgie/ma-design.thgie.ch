        <p>The problems around <strong>privacy</strong> hover mainly
        around the data tracking habits of issuing companies like Google
        or Amazon. Most of my participants were acutely aware of these
        practices. They either took this as the price they have to pay
        or were considering changing providers if a privacy-sensitive
        alternative would exist.</p>
        <p>Generally, these devices are placed within intimate contexts
        of oneâ€™s own life. On the other hand, voice assistants are
        invisible interfaces that withdraw from the negotiation of
        <strong>intimacy</strong>. The problem boils down to us inviting
        these devices into our innermost intimacies, while not offering
        anything similar in return.</p>
        <p>Adding to these two points is the fact, that users have
        little to no control over how they want to interact with the
        voice assistants. Users have no way of giving
        <strong>consent</strong> to many of the processes that are run
        by the device.</p>
        <p>The general problem that arises out of these two themes would
        then be as follows.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Users of voice assistants miss a proper vocabulary to deal
        with the other-than-human presence, especially in case of
        errors, and generally have a hard time bonding with voice
        assistants. They are further unable to deal with issues of trust
        and can assert only little control over the negotiation of this
        important aspect.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Neither the user nor the device knows enough or even can know
        enough, about the other to enable communication and interaction
        that would lead to trust and bonding. The interaction with a
        voice assistant needs to feature implementations of design
        characteristics, that enable the user to no just tolerate but
        embrace the chaotic nature of voice assistants while still being
        to unlock their full potential.</p>
