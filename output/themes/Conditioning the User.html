        <h1 id="conditioning-the-user">Conditioning the User</h1>
        <p>More often than not, the user has to be conditioned into a
        way of communicating or behaving with the assistant as according
        to the manufacturer and developer of the device and assistant.
        They hardly ever have a say in this themselves.</p>
        <p>Behind the acquaintance of a voice assistant device, or
        devices in many cases, lay a specific image of a promised
        future. Home automation, kitchen and household aid, extension of
        the brain.</p>
        <p>These can be rudimentary be merged into one big theme of <a
        href="output/themes/Control%20and%20convenience.html">Control and
        convenience</a>, also known as the preservation of energy by
        offloading tasks to the computer and its attached devices. The
        user becomes conditioned into believing in this future through
        advertisement and clever storytelling. One is promised a simpler
        life, sometimes also a more social or more creative one.</p>
        <p>In my research, I did not find this promised future to
        manifest itself leaving the users more often than not,
        frustrated and the buggy, glitchy, and dumb technology that they
        brought into their homes. Nonetheless, the user sticks with
        their assistant’s limited capabilities but need to drastically
        change their <a
        href="output/themes/Communication,%20Language%20and%20Behavior.html">Communication,
        Language and Behavior</a> towards and with the assistant.</p>
        <p>Users feel that they are having an unnatural interaction with
        the assistant. They need to change their speech patterns, the
        language they usually use or are given irradicate responses by
        the devices. The user thus gets conditioned into behaving as the
        manufacturer of the device wants, to accommodate the limited
        capabilities. Or otherwise, no interaction would be possible at
        all.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>They try repeatedly to play music but the device responds
        with “Je suis désolé, il y a un problème”. At other times, the
        device misunderstands the command but it still doesn’t work. The
        music they wish for can’t be played. They give up, slightly
        annoyed, and concentrate on the situation around the table
        again, eating and socializing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Of course, there are also good moments, and most of the time,
        the assistant does what it is asked for. But this bond, and the
        evoked emotions, are mediocre at best. What sticks with the user
        are mostly frustration, sometimes anger, and in a few cases,
        hate and rage. It is for sure not the promised future that the
        user was tricked into buying into.</p>
        <p>By conditioning the user, by controlling the technological
        narrative, controlling the users’ imagination, <a
        href="research/glossary/GAFA.html">GAFA</a> can bring about their
        utopia. The users know very well about the unsustainability of
        voice assistant technologies, electronics, and the cloud. But
        they don’t see any other alternative, they can’t imagine one.
        And it is the same with privacy issues. Users rather have an
        anonymous big data interface in their home, recording their
        family, than a human researcher observing them.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Yes, many of these, let’s say, gadgets are not very
        sustainable in principle. Because they are rather cheap products
        and are thrown on the market relatively cheaply so that they can
        be distributed as quickly as possible. From that point of view,
        yes, it’s now probably not necessarily the most sustainable.</p>
