        <p>The question of <a
        href="output/themes/What%20is%20a%20voice%20assistant.html">What
        is a voice assistant</a> starts with the device itself. Most
        users are aware, that it is only a minuscule part of a gigantic,
        planet-spanning infrastructure. Though they hardly ever can
        imagine the true size of it.</p>
        <p>The device is simple. A few electronics, chips, some sound
        hardware, that’s it. But already with this simple setup, it
        shares the same problematics as all modern electronics; The
        resources for it come from far away and deep underground. The
        mining operations for the rare earth minerals used in the
        hardware are quite often difficult; for the environment of the
        planet as well as the indigenous people that get poisoned,
        displaced, or robbed of their sustenance. And like all
        electronics, voice assistant devices are hard to recycle. All
        the hard-earned materials are glued together, and properly
        recycling them is not worth the money, or so it seems.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Yes, I see so processors and circuit boards somehow, but I
        have no idea. No, I don’t know, no. I know some technologies, if
        they are in there I don’t know, but I know what decides are some
        Amazon servers and their software behind it. That’s actually, so
        Big Brother-like to me.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The device is the embodiment of the imagination of <a
        href="research/glossary/GAFA.html">GAFA</a>. The big tech
        companies create ecosystems, parallel to that of the planet. But
        their ecosystems are in their complete control. Once in every
        user’s lifetime, they have to make a choice into which ecosystem
        they buy themselves. This choice is hardly ever changed because
        it is not easy to change from one to another. Once ascribed,
        you’re locked in. Not really, but a lot of dark interaction
        patterns make it seem not worthwhile to migrate to another
        ecosystem.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Yes, as I said, that there at Amazon, that they always play
        around there and tinker around, yes. In a very recent case,
        suddenly there was a new voice. If you wanted to listen to
        music, another voice came. I find the voice of the original
        voice very pleasant and I didn’t like this change now at all.
        Others as well, yes. And they just do that then and say nothing,
        ask nothing. Yes, and that’s not nice. You should not do
        that.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The brands, the manufactures of the devices, the developers
        of the assistant are present but have no presence. The devices
        as well as the assistants are supposed to be low friction ware.
        The design is simple, mild in aesthetic choices, easy to blend
        in. But the devices are always on, only off if consciously
        turned off, always listening. With voice assistant devices, tech
        companies can have a permanent foothold in your private space.
        It’s another, constant stream, of information to feed the
        companies big data storages, recommendation algorithms, personal
        user models. A complete loss of privacy. And in this case, your
        whole family is involved. This loss of privacy was common
        knowledge with my participants. But they could not even start to
        fathom the implications or the size of this operation.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>And I appreciate that, for everything that makes my life
        easier in this sense. But I’m basically of the opinion that, for
        example, we don’t actively try to provide the children with
        tablets or cell phones in this sense, but rather the opposite,
        to keep them away from them for as long as possible. Because,
        yes, they come into contact with these things early enough.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The device is manifested, the assistant present; But
        everything else, behind it, becomes many hyperobjects.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>How does consumer technology un-/make our ability to care for
        our companion objects/the material?</p>
