        Application of <em>Animism</em> in Design</h1>
        <p>#essay</p>
        <p>In this text I want to focus on issue I have with the
        research project <em>Animistic design: how to reimagine digital
        interaction between the human and the nonhuman</em>.</p>
        <p>“What this article advocates, then, is a shift toward
        uncertainty-driven scenarios where the unexpected is fostered,
        instead of closed loops, prediction and linearity, and where
        conversations <em>with</em> things, rather than about or to
        things, take place.” <a href="/output/On the Application of Animism in Design.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p>Not necessarily a bad practice, but a case for which I can
        add a critique I’d like to mention this research project by
        Betti Marenko and Philip an Allen. The project concentrated on
        the application of animism in interaction design, with a focus
        on uncertainty. Their approach was to introduce uncertainty into
        the interaction with digital assistants.</p>
        <p>Usually, we expect our interaction with the digital to be of
        deterministic nature. The user gives an input upon which an
        anticipated output is generated. In the case of a digital
        assistant the following scenario could play out. The user asks
        Siri, Apple’s digital assistant, how the weather will be today.
        Siri will respond with a short answer, giving an overview of
        temperature and if there will be rain. Today's digital
        assistants are limited to concise cases where more or less
        precise inputs and outputs can be produced.</p>
        <p>Marenko and van Allen’s research tried to introduce
        uncertainty into this process in the form of digital personas
        with attitude to speculate about different interactions. How
        would the interaction be, if Siri had an uncertain
        character?</p>
        <p>The application of animism in the project, as well as the
        concepts of agency and new materialism, are well based in
        theory. Whereas I’d like to differ is that animism is not merely
        a psychological concept but an entire cosmology, still practiced
        today mostly within indigeneous communities.</p>
        <p>The difference is, that in animism as a psychological concept
        things are put on par with humans, depending on certain
        attributes of said things. Whereas in animism as a cosmology,
        there is no ontological difference between humans and things in
        the first place.</p>
        <p>Basically, I oppose the usage of animism as something simply
        <em>being alive</em> or <em>animated</em>. I would love to have
        a look at animism in design, in which animism means something
        akin to attributing personhood to things.</p>
