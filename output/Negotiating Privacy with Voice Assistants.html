        Privacy with Voice Assistants</h1>
        <p><em>A post-phenomenological approach to privacy and data
        sovereignty in human machine interaction</em></p>
        <p>When you imagine HCI as a spectrum, you have machines on one
        side, and humans on the other. For the longest time, HCI was
        closer to the machine. Starting with punch cards, then the
        keyword and later the mouse, we always had to learn how to talk
        to machines. With touch came a tipping point and with voice
        control we are definitely closer to the human side now.</p>
        <p>Human communication relies on more than one channel. Oral
        communication happens always within a context. Cues are
        exchanged, eye contact or body posture signalize attention, face
        and hands add intent. The cues are missing in the interaction
        with a voice assistant. The communication with them is, despite
        being on the human side of the HCI spectrum, not always very
        easy.</p>
        <p>Within this framing the problem of privacy is of special
        concern. Voice assistants are by default always on and
        listening. More often than not, the assistant misunderstands
        commands - something I experienced myself. This leads to severe
        privacy breaches. For example, mistaken recordings of the user
        are sent to be checked by other humans, making intimate content
        available for an undisclosed public.</p>
        <p>Privacy, from a legal-juridical perspective, is perceived as
        intimacy from a user point of view. Taken together the problem
        arises, that the user is giving up privacy/intimacy in order to
        be able to use this technology without having many possibilities
        of negotiating this.</p>
        <p>These findings are rooted in my own fieldwork as well as
        related literature.</p>
        <p>I would like to answer the question from a user experience as
        well as interaction design perspective, inquiring if the
        introduction of physical cues help the user negotiate
        privacy/intimacy with the machine. Physical cues could be a
        stronger visual representation of the state of the assistant in
        order to inform the user, as well as using touch, movement or a
        beacon-object to signalise certain intents to inform the
        assistant.</p>
        <p>Having more control over the interaction with voice
        assistants could bring back trust that was lost in the process
        of establishing this technology, opening up the way for its
        application in other areas then consumer-tech. The introduction
        of other forms of interactions could diversify the market, which
        is dominated by Amazon and Google, as well as establish niches
        for open source approaches that already exist, but are dependent
        on the market-leaders in their imagination.</p>
