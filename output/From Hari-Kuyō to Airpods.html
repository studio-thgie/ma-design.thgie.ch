        Airpods</h1>
        <p>Feb 09, 2020</p>
        <p>I’m generally interested in the relationship we have with our
        companion objects. Companion objects are things, that we
        interact with on a daily or regular basis and w/o which our
        lifes simply wouldn’t be the same. Chairs, mobile phones, pens,
        cups, underwear, medicaments to name a few.</p>
        <p>My interest got triggered by a set of practices, of which one
        is a religious practice called Hari-Kuyō. This practice or
        festival is of shinto-buddhistic origin and simply said, it’s a
        ceremony to put one’s broken needles to rest. In the
        shinto-buddhistic tradition, things can have spirit and will be
        reborn into the next carmic cycle. If you don’t treat the
        deceased thing right, it might haunt you. Another inspiring
        practice is the one of Kintsugi, in which a broken pot is fixed
        with a mix of resin and gold dust in a process that goes on for
        several weeks.</p>
        <p>It got me interest in how different epistemologies enabling
        different ways of caring about companion objects. Plainly
        spoken, how you think or believe the world to be influences the
        way you treat the material. And it is this practices of care and
        respect that interst me specifically.</p>
        <p>Let us put that aside for the moment. In my project I work
        with a hypothesis: While capitalism took from us the necessity
        to care about things, design took from us the possibility to
        care about things. To expand on the first part: The relationship
        to our companion objects have dramatically changed within the
        last 100 years. The things we have with us became replaceable.
        Furniture, cloth, kitchen tools or electronics became things to
        be consumed quickly and then desposed.</p>
        <p>The other change that companion objects went through is that
        they became incredibly complex and now have a very high negative
        impact on the ecology. For example consumer electronics like
        mobile phones, laptops or cordless headphones. Being made of
        rare earth material, extracted and processed there, where it is
        easier to exploit the working class, leaving behind ecological
        desasters. These things are sleek, but also unappropriatable. We
        can fix them less and less and in the case of the Airpods, they
        transitioned into the perfect consumer good, bought for a
        meaningless fad. The repair aspect is one aspect, another is
        care and maintenance.</p>
        <p>You can keep a knife sharp and leather boots impregnated. You
        can hardly do something similar for a mobile phone, besides a
        case. This has to do with materiality of technology of course,
        but also with how we design things. When Apple thinks about a
        unified user experience and realises them through their
        products, the rest of the world becomes an externality. This is
        called ontological design. They way we think about or practice
        design, in return designs what is or becomes, including
        ourselves.</p>
        <p>And that is why I want to investigate practices of care and
        respectful relationships to our companion objects.</p>
        <p>In my project I will apply said base to a case study about
        Airpods. These little objects brought a subtle but interesting
        technological pardigm shift to light. Technological design is
        very much interested in abolishing the cable to accomplish cloud
        like hardware. But to create this effect, the technology within
        needs to be smaller and smaller and everything becomes battery
        driven. Airpods are virtually unrepairable. They battery dies
        after a good two years. Besides the material impact, the premise
        of it’s rise is very interesting because it’s a product that
        didn’t solve a problem but became a status fetish quickly. Many
        companies are following Apples lead and are taking part in this
        transformation. Last but not least, there are interesting social
        implications, since the usage of headphones changes. There were
        unspoken protocols in place, for example taking out one
        headphone plug when you arrive at the cashier to signal
        attentation to the payment process. People with Airpods leave
        them in most of the time, because they don’t have the capacity
        to handle the little objects efficient enough.</p>
        <p>The design of technological objects keeps us from getting
        into a relationship with them.</p>
        <p>In a caring relationship, time is an important factor. Why
        care if you already now that this particular thing will be
        obsolete soon and in need of replacement. A caring relationship
        also needs time to develop. You need to get to know each other.
        Get used to each other and each others mode of being.</p>
        <p>Caring means, to be emotional invested in each other. Be it
        by mutual feelings or ideological reasoning. Caring needs the
        possibilities to care, to have a base for a practice of care.
        There needs to be a honesty about vulnerabilities, about scars
        and traumas and a safe space for this exchange to happen.</p>
        <p>These technological products that surround us have nothing of
        this. They are envisioned and encapsulated experiences, designed
        for consumption and disposal.</p>
        <p>I hope I can test my hypothesis, form out a critique on
        contemporary technological practices and work in the direction
        of caring and respectful relationships to our companion objects
        within the frame of my project.</p>
