        <h1 id="design-animism-possible-approaches">Design Animism:
        Possible approaches</h1>
        <p>#essay</p>
        <p>At a general level, the research question is as follows</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“How can new materialism help design to reinstigate our
        relationship with the material world, helping us avoid the
        fallacies of modern design’s contribution to consumerism,
        ecological and social damage?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the following I’d like to ruminate quickly on possible
        approaches on introducing aspects of animism or new materialism
        into design.</p>
        <h2 id="rituals">Rituals</h2>
        <p>An important part of animistic practice is the ritualisation
        of material practices. Hari-Kuyō<a href="/output/Design and New Materialism - Possible approaches.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the festival for broken
        needles, acknowledges the work of needle-workers and is a moment
        in which these can show respect for their tools.</p>
        <p>Animistic design could take the ritualisation of care and
        maintenance into account, beyond an imminent use value.
        Hari-Kuyō shows that people can ritualise their bonds to tools,
        as is otherwise only known in rituals for social bonds. The
        aspect of deeply respecting or honoring a thing for its role in
        a common lived reality could be put forward in rituals
        surrounding the maintenance of everyday object, like kitchen
        knives.</p>
        <h2 id="commoning-of-design-and-production-processes">Commoning
        of design and production processes</h2>
        <p>New materialism’s usage of <em>agency</em> isn’t clearly
        defined<a href="/output/Design and New Materialism - Possible approaches.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Roughly said, agency means
        the ontological acceptance of a thing as well as its effect on
        the world, simply because of it’s relationality and complexity
        of being. A simple way of losing the relation to things, or the
        understanding of the complexity of a thing, is to be completely
        removed from the design and production process. As long as
        things are produced outside of my bubble, it’s much easier for
        me to experience them as expendables. The impact of such can be
        seen in the waste of electronic devices.</p>
        <p>An approach for a circumvention of this problem could be the
        commoning of certain processes - design, production,
        maintenance. The act of buying consumer goods releases the buyer
        from the responsibility of these processes, at least that is
        what commodity convenience advertises. Commoning can be
        described as a shared responsibility towards a commodity, its
        usage and care. A commoning of certain processes would mean to
        include the users or a product in design, production or
        maintenance of said product or even let them participate. The
        user is put into relation with the product from the beginning or
        at important stages in the material process of the product and
        knows about the involved complexities of energy and material
        expenditures.</p>
        <h2 id="psychological-aspects">Psychological aspects</h2>
        <p>The psychological values of objects are well researched<a
        href="/output/Design and New Materialism - Possible approaches.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> but not well known by
        designers. This knowledge of the psychological aspects of things
        or the material in general, should be taken into consideration
        by designers. How can products be designed to expand the
        products value by psychological dimensions? A product design
        with that in mind, is not only of use, socio-cultural or
        symbolic value but also a thing with which the user can form a
        strong bond.</p>
        <p>This approach needs to be expanded, as soon as I have gained
        some more knowledge in this field.</p>
        <h2 id="speculation-all-things-have-rights">Speculation: All
        things have rights</h2>
        <p>What if all the things would have the same rights as human
        people, would?</p>
