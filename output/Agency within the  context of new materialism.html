        within the context of new materialism</h1>
        <p>Oct 23, 2019</p>
        <p>In order to enable a basis for design to create a caring
        relationship to designed things, my claim is a re-evaluation of
        these very things and how we treat them. As such, I will
        introduce concepts such as agency and animism. I will argue,
        that such caring practices can be found both in practices of
        animism and in the idea of agency, as it has been
        re-conceptualized by new materialism.</p>
        <p>Care and maintenance are important topics on their own, which
        shall be treated at another time. Animistic practice has the
        potential to introduce such caring practices on a material level
        as shown, for example, by Hari-Kuyō<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, the festival of broken
        needles.</p>
        <h2 id="animism">Animism</h2>
        <p>When working with animism there is generally a wide range of
        understandings of this concept. From my limited experience,
        animism in a eurocentric context is often connected to things
        being animated or alive. This is mostly a psychological point of
        view, in which being alive is attributed in regards to
        interaction patterns<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. While this can
        be useful, I’d love to enrichen this discourse by an ontological
        approach to animism. While in a psychological approach, things
        are put on par with humans because of certain attributes, for
        example responding in a human-understandable way, animism levels
        the ontological hierarchy between human (subject) and thing
        (object) in the first place. Basically, things are treated as
        equals simply for existing. This is not completely right of
        course, but it can hold as an illustration of my intention for
        the moment. This is what I call an ontological approach to
        animism. In animism, things can possess personhood, which means,
        they are treated and related to like persons. This should not be
        confused with anthropomorphizing things. Attributing personhood
        is a way of relating to things that have social, ethical or
        legal implications. An interesting example in this regard is the
        granting of the legal rights of a person to the river Te Awa
        Tupua in New Zealand<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. This
        acknowledgement changed the rivers status from a shared resource
        that needs to be managed to that of a person with the
        capabilities to sue others upon harm done to it. An important
        aspect of personhood is the concept of agency as the ability or
        capacity to act. This term was already heavily reflected in
        western theory, from humanism to post-humanism and lately in new
        materialism. An inquiry into new materialism is especially
        fruitful, since some of its approaches are very similar to some
        of that of animism, in regard to my attempt for an ontological
        approach.</p>
        <h2 id="agency">Agency</h2>
        <p>New materialism is a collection of discourses, originating
        from a theoretical turn around 1990, away from a humanist
        tradition. These discourses seek “a repositioning of the human
        among nonhuman actants, they question the stability of an
        individuated, liberal subject, and they advocate a critical
        materialist attention to the global, distributed influences of
        late capitalism and climate change.”<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Basically, new materialism
        questions the human exceptionalism in the humanist tradition.
        Its origins surely lie in anti-humanism as well as posthumanism.
        I would argue that new materialism in theory equals what animism
        is in practice, as far as this comparison makes sense.</p>
        <p>In or since humanism, agency is understood as the capacity to
        act, usually by a conscious subject. That means, this capacity
        was attributed to moving, thinking, planning and generally
        living beings. Agency was a “quality” mostly attributed to the
        Western subject. This reduced everything else, from universe to
        animals as well as non-western cultures, to kinds of machines or
        savageries upon which the human rational subject can act. Parts
        of this mechanical model of the world, underpinned humanisms and
        colonialisms wrong-doings, which led to the critiques formed in
        anti-humanism. Decades later, there still was a need to
        acknowledge that things do things, without falling into the
        anthropocentric pit. There have been attempts in posthumanism to
        reformulate the concept of agency. Wary of the
        human-centeredness of the term agency, Bruno Latour started to
        use the term actant, which means “something that acts or to
        which activity is granted by others. It implies no special
        motivation of human individual actors, nor of humans in
        general”<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Diana Coleman likewise
        instead used the terminology of “agentic agency”.</p>
        <p>A few years onwards and coming back to new materialism,
        agency is one of the core terms in its theories, although with
        different applications in its various discourses. New
        materialist theorists, like Braidotti, Bennett and Barad revive
        or reread the philosophical tradition of vitalism, in which
        matter is not some passive substance. Matter is conceived as
        something with potential to self-organize and form associations
        with other material systems. It is this potential to do
        something, although void of our understanding of intention, that
        gives agency this relevance in new materialism. Braidotti even
        goes so far to use the term posthuman subjectivity and zoe, bare
        life, in her theories regarding matter<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn6"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Jane Bennett’s approach in her book Vibrant Mater is of
        special interests in my attempt to legitimize animism, or as an
        application or research topic in design. In it, she talks of
        thing-power, and like other theorists of her branch, calls for a
        political treatment of matter and things.</p>
        <p>“Thing-power gestures toward the strange ability of ordinary,
        man-made items to exceed their status as objects and to manifest
        traces of independence of aliveness, constituting the outside of
        our own experience”<a href="/output/Agency within the  context of new materialism.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
        <p>This is where we can find a connection to animism’s
        personhood. Both animism’s and new materialism’s ascription of
        either personhood or agency in matter or things enable a
        political perspective. It is a fundamental reevaluation of the
        ontology of things and how we treat them. I believe that this
        reevaluation can be very valuable, because it has implications
        on a human-understandable or -experienceable level. Unlike the
        hyper-object of the climate crisis, new materialism or animism
        enables humans and communities to have more respectful
        interactions with the environment, through the things around
        them.</p>
        <p>I would love to end this text with the following
        question.</p>
        <p>What is designs response to issues of care and maintenance to
        the things around us, if we consider said things to be
        ontologically on par with us?</p>
