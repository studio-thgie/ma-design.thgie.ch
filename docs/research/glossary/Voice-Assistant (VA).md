# Voice-Assistant
Voice assistants are complex technologies that create a dialogical, spoken interface with computational ressources. Input can be made in the form of a sentence and is given back in the form of spoken sentences. There are usually no visual or material interfaces with voice assistants. All exchanges are made via audio.
