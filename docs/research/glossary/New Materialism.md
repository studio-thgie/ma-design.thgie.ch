# New Materialism
A assemblage of theoretical approaches to flatten her ontological hierarchy between humans and non-humans. New materialism is closely related to the ontological and material turns in critical theory.

> The discourses catalogued under new materialism(s) share an agenda with posthumanism in that they seek a repositioning of the human among nonhuman actants, they question the stability of an individuated, liberal subject, and they advocate a critical materialist attention to the global, distributed influences of late capitalism and climate change. The turn to matter as a necessary critical engagement comes from a collective discontent with the linguistic turn and social constructionism to adequately address material realities for humans and nonhumans alike.
