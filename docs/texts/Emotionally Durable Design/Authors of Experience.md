# Authors of Experience

## Chapter summary

To measure experiences in terms of their intensity or power is counterproductive. It is the subtle and more ephemeral user experiences that penetrate the psyche through the slow passage of time.

Most user experiences are never consciously realized; they are perceived only within deeper levels of processing.

Seldom do we witness users affectionately stroking and caressing machines after they perform well; it often is not until something misbehaves that it actually gets noticed.

Whether planned that way or not, users will have some degree of experience from interacting with practically any object. The crucial thing is to both sustain and evolve that experience so that it is revisited and frequently re-evaluated by the captivated user.

If an object excessively arouses the user, their ability to interact coherently with it deteriorates quickly.

A little misbehaviour here and there is a healthy thing; acting directly against the user's will engenders a high degree of autonomy.

Emotionally demanding objects that do nothing but provoke and antagonize their users may not live long. They are too high maintenance and, thus, a permanent source of irritation.

The Swiss Army Knife approach to design crams in functions often at the expense of usability in an attempt to engender meaning.

Qualitative user experiences are not engendered by incrementally escalating the utilitarian capabilities of a given object or by simply by bolting on extra functionality.

The work of experience designers has tended to centre itself within the digital sphere; however, the discipline's potential stretches far beyond the design of online media.

User experience has always been a design consideration; yet it is a consideration rarely applied to mundane everyday genres of objects,

In today's restless world of unceasing technological miniaturization, the need for objects capable of purveying potent experiential and emotional resonance is greater than ever.

The role of emotion established itself as a branch of design discourse within the latter part of the 20th century, adopting an ever more prevalent position within contemporary design debate today.

It may not be possible to establish a semantic connection between emotions and the very notion of experience or, perhaps, to pin human emotions down within a succinctly unified theory.

It is already tacit to most creative practitioners that emotions play a key role in engendering resonant user experiences; this awareness in itself may actually be enough.

That we have a name for each emotion does not mean we understand them. We have names for the universe and the ancient Chinese system the I-Ching yet both are far from understood.

Emotional responses provide the foundations of individuality: they are what distinguish us from others. Products provide triggers for this vital sociological process to occur.

Although designers can elicit emotional responses, the explicit nature of the response is beyond control. The unique assemblage of past experiences particular to each user determines this.

Designers need only provoke an emotional response - whatever that may be - as users will ultimately project their personality onto the object just as long as it continues to stimulate that vital response.

Immersive experiences are all encompassing, provoking meaningful associations that frequently catalyse robust emotional connections between subject and object.

In failing to evolve, the intensity and meaning of a given stimulus crumbles away simply through familiarity and repetition.

## A toolbox of ideas

Strike a balance: emotionally demanding objects that do nothing but provoke and antagonize their users may not live long; they are too high maintenance and, thus, a permanent source of irritation. Always aim to establish equilibrium between optimal degrees of emotional arousal, with a consistent measure of usability and performance. This will facilitate the smooth delivery of rich and emotionally charged experiences without compromising the behavioural fluidity of elementary subject-object interaction.

Provoke a response: design objects that provoke some kind of emotional response from the user. The way in which we each respond emotionally to given stimuli is what both separates and defines us as unique individuals; therefore, creating objects and experiences that provoke a distinct and clear emotional response - whatever the response may be â€“ will engender the felt sense of individuality, self-definition and the affirmation of identity within users.

Designers also consume: when attempting to design for and anticipate an emotional response, start by evaluating your own responses to things and consider how you might perceive a given experience. As designers we are fortunate to have experience as both creators and end users; it is crucial that this simple fact is never forgotten as intuitive insight frequently provides the most potent creative tool.

Create meaning: a meaningful association must first be perceived within an object before users may experience any arousal and subsequent emotion. Easily cognizable meanings provide the essential foundation upon which arousal and emotion are constructed. Therefore, it is helpful to consider how an object will be perceived by the user and what meanings may be associated with that initial perception.
