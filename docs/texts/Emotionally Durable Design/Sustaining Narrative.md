# Sustaining Narrative

## Chapter summary

Beneath the silken skin of mass manufacturing, harsh contradictions dwell regarding the explicit nature of the newness that consumers actually desire.

Objects capable of delivering durable narrative experiences already pollute the mainstream, though most remain cautiously quarantined within lowtech product genres.

Consciousness is interpreted by consumers as the feeling that something has autonomy: a set of intentions based purely around one's particular existence, or something that seems to be in possession of its own free will or alterity.

Objects that evolve slowly over time build up layers of narrative by reflecting traces of the user's invested care.

JNDs define the amount that something must be altered in order for the difference to be perceivable.

When consumers develop empathy with products, a visceral empathy is nurtured with the brand; customers are subsequently kept loyal and market share is healthily sustained.

Narrative experiences must not be over-programmed; spontaneous occurrences create the magic between subject and object. Without them, relationships seldom supersede the banal. Spontaneity and magic should be catalysed rather than planned through an object's ability to echo the idiosyncrasies of each individual user.

Most consumer products are like stories with an incredible opening line, but which just continue repeating it throughout. Their storytelling capabilities are pathetically limited.

Transient consumption is not unlike the consumption of stories, movies and gossip; it, too, is goal orientated, with a strong emphasis on uncovering mystery and knowing all there is to know.

Durable narratives must side step the deflowering gaze of the consumer, maintaining enchantment while never actually being fully understood. Captivating narratives must play on our deepest desires, dreams and fears in order to hold us in their grasp: enchanted and helpless.

The pace at which narratives unfold is as crucial as the narrative itself; too slow, and it will generate frustration, too fast and it will alienate the consumer through utter confusion.

Durable narrative experiences must embody multiple layers, enabling a number of co-dependent narratives to be experienced simultaneously – revealing, on discovery, not answers or grand finales but deeper and more complex layers.

A frame tale is a sustainable narrative technique in which the main story is constructed in order to organize a collection of shorter stories, concocting rich narrative textures loaded with tension and complexity.

A smooth shift must occur; if a storyteller were to continually switch stories every few lines, we would surely become lost and, consequently, experience alienation. If the story is incrementally developed and grown, we engage passionately with it.

Users must be designed into object narratives as co-producers and not simply as inert, passive witnesses, a process that enables the nature of user interaction to shape the emergent narrative.

Patina writes narrative into both the semiotic make-up and aggregate semantic of material experiences, holding great influence over the particular nature of the experiences that users are likely to perceive. However, the values affixed to the ageing of material surfaces are loaded with contradiction and are, at present, deeply genre specific.

It is imperative that patina is seen as a co-dependent element of the whole, rather than a one-stop approach to durable product design. Patina is, indeed, a potent addition to the designer's toolbox, but one that must be deployed with subtlety and caution.

In any physical product scenario, the ageing process will occur as it always does. It is therefore crucial that products are designed to both accommodate and embrace their inevitable future. This way the onset of ageing will concentrate rather than dilute the gestalt, while reframing signs of age and overall product maturity as desirable consumer destinies.

## A toolbox of ideas

Layers of narrative: durable narrative experiences must embody multiple layers, allowing numerous interwoven narratives to be simultaneously cognized and revealing, on discovery, not answers or grand finales, but deeper and more complex layers lurking even deeper within the object's semiotic make-up. Frame tales are helpful here, whereby a main story is constructed in order to organize a collection of shorter sub-stories, enabling the artful concoction of rich narratives loaded with tension and complexity.

Producers not observers: when embedding narrative experiences within products, always perceive the user more as a co-producer of the narrative, rather than just a passive observer. This way, the narrative experience that does eventually unfold will be a unique experience since it has – to some degree - been shaped and produced by each unique and individual user.

Pace: pay careful attention to the pace at which narrative experiences unfold; too slow and they will generate frustration, too fast and they will alienate the consumer through utter confusion. Ideally, pace should be varied, ensuring that an air of uncertainty circulates the object, while also optimizing the sense of anticipation to nurture an intense connectedness between subject and object.

Ageing gracefully: anticipate the ageing process of objects. Whether we like it or not, things get old, and it is imperative that we begin designing for desirable ageing as a means to embrace their inevitable futures. This is not to say that everything should be made using wood, denim or perhaps, leather; rather, provocative design concepts must emerge that challenge our social desire for a scratch-free world, illustrating how the onset of ageing could actually concentrate rather than dilute the gestalt.
