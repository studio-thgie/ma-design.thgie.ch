# The Progress Illusion
## Chapter summary

Environmental concern is nothing new; recorded awareness of human impact on the biosphere dates as far back as the 13th century.

Connections between emergent cultures of superfluous materialism and environmental decay were acknowledged in late 19th-century Britain at the dawn of the decadent Arts and Crafts period.

Population growth alone is not a problem for planet Earth; the growth of a species whose presence has negative impacts on all other life must be seen as a potential ecological crisis.

The rampant consumption and waste of natural resources so prevalent in the developed world is a legacy of modern times, born largely from the inappropriate marriage of excessive material durability with fleeting product-use careers.

In their current guise, sustainable design methodologies lack philosophical depth, adopting a symptom-focused approach comparable to that of Western medicine.

Despite the efforts of sustainable design, today's consumers continue wastefully on, but now with recycled materials instead of virgin ones.

Many researchers are beginning to suspect that recycling actually provides an ethical 'get out of jail free' card, liberating consumer conscience and generating even more waste.

The future survival of many large brands will become increasingly dependent upon both the delivery and perceptibility of eco-conscious practices and products.

Mainstream industrial design has become technocentric, incorporating contemporary technologies within archaic product typologies.

During recent years, technological innovation has taken centre stage at the expense of other less tangible, though equally potent, creative considerations

Material possessions are deployed as signifiers of status, casting us within socially desirable roles, stimulating edgy cultures of habitual comparing.

Both the range and intensity of emotional experiences delivered by products born of a technocentric mindset are incredibly limited and offer very little to users.

Placing technological contemporaneousness as the sole product valueindicator ensures loss of meaning the moment a newer model hits the shelves.

Technocentric design will fade as consumers tire of chasing unattainable utopias, giving way to new specialist genres of design and consumption fuelled by more profound and poetic user experiences that penetrate the psyche over time.

The 20th century witnessed a steady societal migration away from deep communal values toward a fast-food culture of nomadic individualism and excessive materialism; today, empathy is consumed not so much from each other, but through fleeting embraces with objects.

Developed world consumer desires relentlessly grow and flex, while material possessions remain hopelessly frozen in time. The mountain of waste this single inconsistency generates is apocalyptic, coming at increasing cost to legislation-swamped manufacturers and the natural world.

Landfills around the word swell with fully functional appliances - freezers that still freeze and toasters that still toast - their only crime being a failure to sustain empathy with their users.

Emotionally Durable Design will transport users beyond the ephemeral world of technocentric design toward a rich, interactive domain of emotionally durable objects and experiences.

## A toolbox of ideas

Environment as user: when attempting to engage with sustainability, think of the environment as just another end user â€“ a user with specific needs, demands and limitations. It follows that good design, therefore, will aim to accommodate the requirements of all potential users: corporate, consumer and environment.

Material life: when planning product lifespan, consider the lifespan of the materials from which the product is made. For example, renewable materials from the biosphere, including compostable plant-based composites and biopolymers, all offer designers a short-lived and lowimpact alternative to the recyclable, but all too durable, plastics, elastomers and resins that are so widely used today; immune to the glare of biological decay, these materials grossly outlive our desire for them.

Causes not symptoms: adopt the philosophy of ancient Chinese medicine; focus on the causes of our environmental destruction, not just on how to clean up or minimize the obvious after-effects. Rather than solely addressing waste, target and design for the motivations underpinning it; this is where the fundamental changes lurk.

Poetic potential: think beyond technological modernity by exploring the potential for other, more poetic, experiential and interactive forms of product evolution and innovation - embedding less transient, enduring values within products that may be sustained through the slow passing of time.
