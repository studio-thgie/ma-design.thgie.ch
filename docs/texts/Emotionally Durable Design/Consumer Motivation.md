# Consumer Motivation
 ## Chapter summary 
 Material consumption is driven by complex motivations and is about far more than just the acquisition of newer, shinier things. It is an endless personal journey toward the ideal or desired self that, by its very nature, becomes a process of incremental destruction.

Ecological procrastination could be likened to the experience of delaying a visit to the dentist. Though perfectly aware that each day brings further discomfort, the decaying tooth goes unattended, ensuring that the inevitable operation will be far more dreadful when it does eventually arrive.

We are consumers of meaning and not matter; products provide a chassis that signify the meanings to be consumed. We transfer resources into products that - in a sense - provide us with existential mirrors, allowing us to view and experience our dreams and desires in real time.

Material consumption operates on a range of experiential layers; consumers mine these layers, unearthing meaningful content as they steadily excavate deeper into the semiotic core of an object. Designers must weave intricacy amongst the layers of an object in order to optimize the sustainability of this meaningfulness.

New needs emerge the moment old needs are met, thus nurturing the infinite sequence of desire and destruction that is so characteristic of the modern world

The notion of meaning is highly context specific: the meaning of a rat in a pet shop differs greatly from that of the same rat in a restaurant kitchen. Meaning can thus be loosely directed by designers, but never fully controlled

Doggedly pursuing the dream of a technologically enhanced and physically durable world has enabled us to fabricate a plateau of material immunity. Durable metals, polymers and composite materials have enabled us to construct this synthetic "futurescape'; immune to the glare of biological decay, these materials grossly outlive our desire for them and so the illusion of control bares its first predicament: waste.

Conventional wisdom dictates that goods are nullified by substantial shifts in technology, format or other operational protocol; however, obsolescence is also a consumer side issue driven by the failure of products to quench the human thirst for new, fresh experiences.

The uptake of products is partially motivated by the notion of deflowering; we consume the unknown in order to demystify and familiarize. Modern products lack character; they are too smart and precise, removing all possible surprise, mystery and, perhaps above all, charm from the process of engagement.

The ego exists as an accumulation of aspirations and dreams, maintaining false appearances and portraying an aggregate self-image of coherence, completeness and success.

As a materialist society, we commonly represent and communicate the fabric of our egos through objects as opposed to language.

Most products are capable of creating even a small amount of empathy at the point of purchase; from this point on, however, product lifespans depend upon the sustainability of that empathy. Waste, therefore, could be seen as a symptom of expired empathy: a failed relationship that led to the dumping of one by the other.

In human pair bonding, when empathy fades the original bond weakens. Another fresh bonding urge is motivated, resulting in the acquisition of another; the original relationship is rendered obsolete.

Various notions of product life orbit the creative sphere and have done so for some time. In the majority of cases, objects are supposedly rendered durable via the specification of resilient materials, repairable technologies and robust design engineering. Landfills bloat with strata upon strata of durable goods, slowly living out their tough robust existences beneath 10,000 tonnes of likeminded scrap.

There is little point designing physical durability into consumer goods if consumers have no desire to keep them.

In attending solely to physical ageing, designers overlook numerous metaphysical renderings of durability. As a creative industry it is vital that we break away from the physical and begin to understand more about the sustainability of empathy, meaning, desire and other metaphysical factors that influence the duration of product life.

## A toolbox of ideas 

See beyond the physical: it is important to see beyond the physical, attending equally to the meanings that a product signifies. Essentially, consumers acquire meanings, not objects; objects simply provide a way of perceiving the meaning. Furthermore, try to gauge through scenario-building to what degree these meanings are sustainable and how they might evolve over time, if at all.

Relinquish control: avoid over-programming the product semantic to ensure that sufficient space is left for the inclusion of the user's psyche. The ambiguous qualities that manifest as a result of designing in this way increase the likelihood of chance discoveries, randomness and intimacy, which, in turn, greatly facilitate the nurture of subject-object empathy.

Keep the magic alive: make sure that a few cards are concealed up the object's sleeve; if a product relinquishes all meaning in a single fleeting glance - experientially â€“ consumers have nowhere left to go. By designing products to patiently deliver a series of future discoveries and revelatory happenings, the life of an object is dramatically increased as users remain captivated in anticipation of the next event.

Meaning is context specific utilize the instability of meaning as an agent of chance. Object meanings change significantly in relation to their contextual surroundings; designers must embrace this unpredictable quality as it enables objects to radiate multiple personalities, which scupper the user's attempts to out-know them.
