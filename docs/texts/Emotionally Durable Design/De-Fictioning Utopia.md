# De-Fictioning Utopia

## Chapter summary 

Utopias are vital; they free us from the shackles of an imperfect present by revealing a limitless world of imaginable futures. Yet they also possess a dark side that sets up unrealistic expectations, generating false hopes and, ultimately, fostering restless cultures of perpetual disenchantment with the now.

By producing streams of objects that signify Utopian values based upon a single prescribed and socially approved version of reality, material culture becomes inadvertently homogenized into one popular version.

Fiction does not simply exist for the sole purpose of entertainment and is more than just a literary genre or category of movie per se. Fiction performs a vital role by weaving rich narrative threads throughout our daily lives.

The desire to explore and consume fictions as perceived in objects bears strong similarities to the way in which we might consume a fictitious movie, play or novel; the emphasis is not on authenticity or truth, but on experience and meaning.

As daily life continues to become more and more programmed, the need for fiction, complexity and dialogue in this over-streamlined world increases exponentially

New and, consequently, unfamiliar products radiate mysterious, enigmatic qualities that quickly crumble away once familiarity begins to accumulate between user and product.

For an object to continually portray a fictional gestalt, it must first possess an ability to conceal, holding a few cards up its sleeve in order to avoid total discovery,

Products possessing overly programmed semantics, or perfect products, are particularly vulnerable to the glare of de-fictioning; they are too easy to map and pigeonhole.

Deeper and more intense bonds are forged between users and objects when products portray a perceivable sense of consciousness. This is not to say that objects should literally be conscious; but, rather, a given object may react to its surroundings with an ontological receptiveness and flexibility of judgement that creates the impression of - or simulates - consciousness.

Tools that begin to explore consciousness simulation, such as artificial intelligence and artificial life, are all too frequently discussed in terms of their ability to remove the decision-making process from humans.

We bring our own psychological baggage into the meaning-consumption loop; this is why material engagements can seem so personal to us.

We pick up brief reflections of identity through phantile drives (PDs) buried deep within products' layers of signification. PDs are like motors that generate meaning once perceived; they are phantile in the sense that they are both metaphysical and deeply suggestive.

PDs are frequently deployed to generate eye-opening jolts and quirky surprises, like the hello greeting on a HIFI display. Gimmicks such as these exemplify one way of working with PDs. They deliver an opening jolt of reasonable intensity, yet somehow fail to sustain wonderment through the passing of time, due once again to the PDs' inability to grow and evolve over time,

The designing of omnipresent PDs may be facilitated by incorporating a measure of openness - or space - within product semantics, enhancing the degree of self that may be invested into the discursive engagement between subject and object.

Foreignments may be generated or driven, provided that the difference in a given network of meanings is only partially modified. Total difference will effectively place the network beyond perceivable recognition and, in so doing, will alienate the user through an absence of lucid understanding and familiarity.

The ebb and flow of information that surges between subject and object is dramatically influenced by users themselves. We bring our own catalogue of meanings into any given network, and these meanings greatly influence the way in which the said network will be perceived. This means that no two people will perceive the same jolt – or PD – in the same way.

PDs deliver surprises and jolts. Omnipresent PDs render the said surprises and jolts amorphous, enabling them to evolve through time while the user simultaneously evolves and grows.

## A toolbox of ideas 

Experience over authenticity: when embedding fictions within the semantic layers of an object, try to focus on their experiential dimensions rather than what simply constitutes conventional reality per se. Thinking beyond - or simply ignoring - the accountable will unveil a far greater potential. We should not be inhibited by inept notions of accountability and truth; instead, let us explore the profound and the numinous in search of alternative and more provocative modes of material engagement.

Avoid cheap tricks: PDs are, indeed, potent meaning generators, but only when they are deployed in a subtle and artful manner. To achieve and sustain this level of sensitivity, it may sometimes be necessary for the driven meaning to appear accidental, engendering further meaning within the user while reducing the gap between subject and object. PDs must not be signposted; they should be unwittingly discovered by the user

Keep it moving it is crucial that fictions evolve and grow; if they are static – providing one single repetitive jolt - they will soon lose their impact and subsequently become de-fictioned by the user. To remain potent, therefore, fiction must continually enchant users by shifting and evolving at all times. Transience of this kind may be achieved through deliberately deceiving or misdirecting users, creating multiple false information flows that may be switched at any time.

Avoid over-programming. it is vital that a degree of ambiguity and space is embedded within a given product semantic. This means that although sufficient intuitive information may be made evident for the user to operate the product, undefined interactive space should also be made available to be explored and defined by the subject as the relationship unfolds. This undefined space also provides a kind of mirror, which reflects back the individual idiosyncrasies of each user, rendering each interaction unique and personal.
