## Notes on Transcripts
Most Interviews were held in Swiss-German dialekt as this was the most natural way of talking. In the transcripts I opted for a translation into german to enable an easier and automated translations into other languages. As the analysis is mostly interested into the  semantic content of what was said, as opposed to how it was said, I ommited expletive words and delay sounds.
