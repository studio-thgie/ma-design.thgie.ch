# Being scared bc9PVK

Participant was outside in the garden when the parrots started to scream a lot. Wondering what was happening she reentered the home. The voice assistant was playing Maria Carries *All I Want for Christmas* with maximum volume. The participant tried to lower the volume via Google Home app, but the volume kept on rising again. Nobody else was around, who could play a prank. At this point the participant became really scared. ([[assistant is creepy]], [[assistant is spooky]], [[controlling the music]], [[negative serendipity]], [[third party plays around]])

It turned out, that her sister, who lives upstairs was trying out the Google Home app and connected to the participants device. Because she could not hear the song playing she upped the volume.
