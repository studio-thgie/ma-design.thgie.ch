# Findings and Output
The thematic analysis was a very important corner stone during the research. It concluded the ethnographic phase and produced valuable insights into what relationships we have with voice assistants.

These are intermitten presentations that I could produce out of the research material and thoughts that went into the projects, but are not related to the structure of the MA Design.

## Texts and Essay
These are texts that came into existence during my MA studies but are not directly related to the research focus. I included them here because they are important to my personal basic stance on how I conduct research.

- [[Negotiating Privacy with Voice Assistants]]
- [[Animistic Emotionally Durable Design]]
- [[Trees]]
