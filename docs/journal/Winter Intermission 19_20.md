# Winter Intermission 19/20
Dec 26, 2019

My last coaching session brought some clarification into how I should formulate a research question. An important part of the question, and what I often do wrong, is to take care of built in assumptions. I often stated a goal to be reached through the research and that made the research part almost just an alibi. I also updated my collection on writing practice with some material regarding the research question.
