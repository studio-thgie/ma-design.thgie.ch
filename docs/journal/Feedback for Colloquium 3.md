# Feedback for Colloquium 3
The writen feedback mostly mirrored what we discussion after the presentation's Q&A. Especially Roberts remark, that the project is behind schedule, is on point and also my main concern. With the shift I did in the last semester I lost a lot of valueable time. I'm nonetheless very happy with the decision. The project's focus feels proper now. It makes sense, is relevant and also well bodied.

I'm trying to organize a workshop or at least a mini focus group, but with the rising covid numbers I doubt such a thing will be feasable. I will at least have another go at an interview and hope to get some last information before the final writing sprint.

Let's see what else can be done this late in the project.
