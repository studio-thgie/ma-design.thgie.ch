# feeling insecure
I observed a lot of insecurities in the interaction between user and device. Sometime the users feel not skilled enough to use the device and sometimes the device doesn't give proper interaction clues, if it understand the command for example. The user is also conditioned into insecurity through the many instances where the device doesn't work as intended.
