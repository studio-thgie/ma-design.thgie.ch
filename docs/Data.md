# Data
The interviews and observations are among the core data which was also extensively analysed through [[Thematic Analysis]].
- [[Interviews]] and their transcripts
- [[Participatory Observations]] 

Further data that underlined certain aspects of the analysis are as follows.
- [[Photographic Observations]]
- [[Prototyping I]]
- [[Expert Workshop I]]

## Additional Data
The experience reports did not go directly into the [[Thematic Analysis]], but they were informative of certain language patterns. As such I kept it here. There list of participants is anonymised. That collection hold together certain data points, such as different observations and interviews with the same person.
