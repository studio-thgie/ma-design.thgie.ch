  abstract = {In time, phenomenology has become a viable approach to conducting qualitative studies in education. Popular and well-established methods include descriptive and hermeneutic phenomenology. Based on critiques of the essentialism and receptivity of these two methods, however, this article offers a third variation of empirical phenomenology: Postphenomenology. The article introduces postphenomenology, a philosophy of technology that highlights the importance of technological mediation of experience: Technologies transform our perceptions (amplify/reduce) and translate our actions (invite/inhibit). Based on this framework, two approaches to empirical fieldwork are suggested: In-depth exploration of the typical use of a given technology and critical comparison of multiple versions of a technology. It is argued that using postphenomenology as a research method helps researchers explore technological mediation, a vital and oft-neglected aspect of educational practice, but the method simultaneously entails epistemological commitments such as multistability, reflexivity, and posthumanism. The article concludes by discussing future challenges for the postphenomenological method.},

  abstract = {Agency is the capacity of an actor to act in a given environment. The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and moral agency is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.},

  abstract = {We have no interest whatever in minimizing the continuing history of racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive biologisms, or the urgency of their exposure, that has made the gravamen of so many contemporary projects of critique. At the same time, we fear — with installation of an automatic antibiologism as the unshifting tenet of `theory' — the loss of conceptual access to an entire thought-realm. (Sedgwick and Frank, 1995: 15), I was left wondering what danger had been averted by the exclusion of biology. What does the nominative `biological or anatomical body' actually refer to? And what secures the separation of its inadmissible matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions? When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I don't mean this body'. And so it seemed with a gesture so matter of fact that it required no further comment, the fact of (the) matter was both decided and dispatched. (Kirby, 1997: 70), Feminism has been as deeply implicated in routinized antiessentialism as any of our critical procedures. Even though questions of `the body' have become increasingly fashionable in all manner of feminist projects (surely `the body' has become, in a very short space of time, one of our most routinized theoretical gestures), the schedule of feminism's antibiologism has been little altered. In most of these projects on `the body', the body in question is pursued in its socially, experientially, or psychically constituted forms, but rarely in its physiologically, biochemically, or microbiologically constituted form, the idea of biological construction having been rendered either unintelligible or naive. Despite an avowed interest in the body, there is a persistent distaste for biological detail. (Wilson, 1998: 14—15), These feminist theories have usually been reluctant to engage with biological data: they retain, and encourage, the fierce antibiologism that marked the emergence of second wave feminism. (Wilson, 2004: 13), That feminist scholars are particularly prone to a `knee jerk constructivism' helps explain the reluctance of those in the humanities to engage seriously with the claims of science. (Squier, 2004: 46), This book functions primarily as a reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly those interested in feminism, antiracism and questions of the politics of globalisation, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of research, if not necessary to, then certainly useful for more incisively formulating the concepts on which they so heavily, if implicitly rely. It is written as a remembrance of what we have forgotten — not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient, striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant, brute world of materiality, a world regulated by the exigencies, the forces, of space and time. We have forgotten the nature, the ontology, of the body, the conditions under which bodies are encultured, psychologized, given identity, historical location, and agency. We have forgotten where we come from. (Grosz, 2004a: 2)},

As appliances and computation move away from the desktop, and as designers move toward designing for emotion and social connection rather than usability and utility, we are poised to design technologies that are explicitly intimate and/or intimacy promoting. This workshop will: critically reflect on notions of intimacy; consider cultural and ethical issues in designing intimate technologies; and explore potential socio-technical design methods for intimate computing.},

The problem with these approaches to socially responsible design is that they are usually based on a given set of design methods. Such methods respond to conditions of practice that are outmoded and don’t respond to the contemporary presence of the image, and it’s affect on materiality and the body in design practice. This is a problem in relation to evolving ecologies where new methods are needed to tackle problems that arise because of the change. In response, this work tries to develop alternative design methods for social change, particularly by exploring the relationships between image and vital material as a key variable. Through a series of experiments the work argues for the potential of material as foundational for creating changing within a system. This proposes engagement with material, body, space \& image as a precursor to the linear and formalistic version of the design process.},

Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities. Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future? 'The Posthuman' concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities.},

The book takes us beyond the sustainable design field's established focus on energy and materials, to engage the underlying psychological phenomena that shape patterns of consumption and waste. In fluid and accessible writing, the author asks: why do we discard products that still work? He then moves forward to define strategies for the design of products that people want to keep for longer. Along the way we are introduced to over twenty examples of emotional durability in smart phones, shoes, chairs, clocks, teacups, toasters, boats and other material experiences. Emotionally Durable Design transcends the prevailing doom and gloom rhetoric of sustainability discourse, to pioneer a more hopeful, meaningful and resilient form of material culture. This second edition features pull-out quotes, illustrated product examples, a running glossary and comprehensive stand firsts; this book can be read cover to cover, or dipped in-and-out of. It is a daring call to arms for professional designers, educators, researchers and students from in a range of disciplines from product design to architecture; framing an alternative genre of design that reduces the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and things"--Page 4 de la couverture.},

Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism).

Drawing on a survey of eighty families in Chicago who were interviewed on the subject of their feelings about common household objects, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton provide a unique perspective on materialism, American culture, and the self. They begin by reviewing what social scientists and philosophers have said about the transactions between people and things. In the model of 'personhood' that the authors develop, goal-directed action and the cultivation of meaning through signs assume central importance. They then relate theoretical issues to the results of their survey. An important finding is the distinction between objects valued for action and those valued for contemplation. The authors compare families who have warm emotional attachments to their homes with those in which a common set of positive meanings is lacking, and interpret the different patterns of involvement. They then trace the cultivation of meaning in case studies of four families. Finally, the authors address what they describe as the current crisis of environmental and material exploitation, and suggest that human capacities for the creation and redirection of meaning offer the only hope for survival. A wide range of scholars - urban and family sociologists, clinical, developmental and environmental psychologists, cultural anthropologists and philosophers, and many general readers - will find this book stimulating and compelling." http://www.loc.gov/catdir/description/cam022/81001443.html.},

For example, conversational systems often use female voices in subservient roles. They also exclude marginalized groups, such as non-binary individuals, altogether. Speech recognition systems also have significant gender, race and dialectal biases [14, 15, 19]. Instead, there is an opportunity for these systems to help change gender norms and promote inclusion and diversity as we continue to struggle with gender equality [10], and progress towards LGBTQ+ rights across the globe [13]. However, prior research claims that users strongly dislike voices without clear gender markers or misalignments between a voice and personality [12]. This calls for additional research to understand how voice assistants may be designed to not perpetuate gender bias while promoting user adoption.},

  abstract = {International Journal of Design, IJDesign, IJD, SCI, SSCI, A\&HCI, Objects often become cherished for their ties to beliefs, experiences, memories, people, places or values that are significant to their owner. These ties can reflect the ways in which we as humans use objects to characterise, communicate and develop our sense of self. This paper outlines our approach to applying product attachment theory to design practices. We created six artefacts that were inspired by interviews conducted with three individuals who discussed details of their life stories. We then evaluated the associations that came to mind for our participants when interacting with these newly designed artefacts to determine whether these links brought meaning to them. Our findings highlight the potential of design to bring emotional value to products by embodying significant aspects of a person’s self-identity. To do so, designers must consider both the importance and authenticity of the associations formed between an object and an individual.},

\textbf{Conclusion}
\par
"Product attachment theory suggests that people develop an attachment to an object for its role in the construction, maintenance or development of an aspect of their self-identity. These objects are often assigned emotional value for their associations to memories, experiences, values, aspirations, people or places. We set out to explore the potential for design to promote the formation of product attachment by developing a process of designing objects with meaningful associations, using the life stories of our intended users as inspiration for the creation of several artefacts. Our evaluation of these artefacts reflected mixed results that highlight the need for designers to consider both the importance of an associated aspect of identity and the authenticity of the embodiment itself to create objects that hold meaning for an individual. We intend for the process and resulting artefacts presented in this paper to inspire designers to further explore the value of meaningful associations in their practice to enrich user-product relationships."}

In this paper, we thematically describe 12 vignettes which represent embodied and sonic experiments using a combination of design, data-driven art, cyber crafts, found-object and traditional percussion instruments, spoken word, and movement. We conclude with a discussion of how the experiments worked as a multifaceted whole, and how we used interdisciplinary methods as a central approach.},

To inform design decisions of how to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the users’ point of view, an online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone VAPA such as Apple’s Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private vs. public) and type of information (private vs. nonprivate). Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.}

The prototype was developed together with recapp IT (https://recapp.ch\hspace{0pt}), who provided their Swiss German speech recognition technology. Voice assistants are gaining importance as future human-computer interfaces in our lives. However, so far, there was no broad adoption in Switzerland. We believe that a significant reason for this is how Swiss German speakers have to interact with these voice assistants. None of today's assistants speaks or understands the various dialects in Switzerland, thus making communicating with them feel unnatural and uncanny. In this project, we propose to build a new text-to-speech model for different Swiss German dialects. Such a synthesis model can be applied in many different contexts beyond voice assistants such as podcasts, article narration, and automatic radio show generation. This work's final outcome will be a model that translates High German text to Swiss German speech. Please note that this is a work in progress.},

With the recent advances in inclusive technology, it is possible to extend the support given to people with visual impairment. This project is proposed to help those people who are blind or visually impaired using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Image and Text Recognition. The idea is implemented through Android mobile app that focuses on voice assistant, image recognition, currency recognition, e-book, chat bot etc. The app is capable to assist using voice command to recognize objects in the surrounding, do text analysis to recognize the text in the hard copy document.

Throughout this thesis, I apply Timothy Morton’s dark ecology theory that argues that an awareness of negativity and tragic melancholy is  necessary in order to understand our current ecological climate. This mood is integral to closing the gap between internal human involvement and the supposed external environment. The first section Animism - from deep roots to dark loops is devoted to a theoretical unpacking of animism  as a dark contested theory in relation to the darkness of our present ecology in crisis.  In the second section, Aesthetic animism, I discuss my own creative practice as an expression of ecological thought supported by an animist mode of perceiving. Animism is unpacked as an outsider philosophy joins forces with working with waste matter in my art-design practice, more specifically the excrement of the ocean. This text incorporates a synergy between knowledge and visuality, text and designed objects as a means of practicing ecological literacy.  In order to aid the ecology in crisis this text argues for a renewed, modest, prophetic kinship with our environment, that extends a hand towards non-human agents including the earth  within a practice based research process in the realm of visual arts.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely used throughout our economy in making decisions that have far-reaching impacts on employment, education, access to credit, and other areas. Initially considered neutral and fair, ML algorithms have recently been found increasingly biased, creating and perpetuating structural inequalities in society. With the rising concerns about algorithmic bias, a growing body of literature attempts to understand and resolve the issue of algorithmic bias. In this tutorial, we discuss five important aspects of algorithmic bias. We start with its definition and the notions of fairness policy makers, practitioners, and academic researchers have used and proposed. Next, we note the challenges in identifying and detecting algorithmic bias given the observed decision outcome, and we describe methods for bias detection. We then explain the potential sources of algorithmic bias and review several bias-correction methods. Finally, we discuss how agents’ strategic behavior may lead to biased societal outcomes, even when the algorithm itself is unbiased. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Ambiguity is usually considered anathema in Human Computer Interaction. We argue, in contrast, that it is a resource for design that can be used to encourage close personal engagement with systems. We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.},

  abstract = {Edited by Richard Grusin of the Center for 21st Century Studies, this is the first book to name and characterize-and therefore consolidate-a wide array of current critical, theoretical, and philosophical approaches to the humanities and social sciences under the concept of the nonhuman turn. Each of these approaches is engaged in decentering the human in favor of a concern for the nonhuman, understood by contributors in a variety of ways-in terms of animals, affectivity, bodies, materiality, technologies, and organic and geophysical systems.  The nonhuman turn in twenty-first-century studies can be traced to multiple intellectual and theoretical developments from the last decades of the twentieth century: actor-network theory, affect theory, animal studies, assemblage theory, cognitive sciences, new materialism, new media theory, speculative realism, and systems theory. Such varied analytical and theoretical formations obviously diverge and disagree in many of their assumptions, objects, and methodologies. However, they all take up aspects of the nonhuman as critical to the future of twenty-first-century studies in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  Unlike the posthuman turn, the nonhuman turn does not make a claim about teleology or progress in which we begin with the human and see a transformation from the human to the posthuman. Rather, the nonhuman turn insists (paraphrasing Bruno Latour) that "we have never been human," that the human has always coevolved, coexisted, or collaborated with the nonhuman-and that the human is identified precisely by this indistinction from the nonhuman.

Es zeigen sich dabei sprachliche und kulturelle Praktiken, die durch die Integration artifizieller Mündlichkeit in die Interaktion entstehen, wie sie bisher noch nicht beschrieben werden konnten. Diese untersucht der gesprächslinguistisch ausgerichtete Teilbereich des Projekts B06 „Un/erbetene Beobachtung in Interaktion: ,Intelligente Persönliche Assistenten‘ (IPA)“ im Sonderforschungsbereich „Medien der Kooperation“ an der Universität Siegen. Sprachassistenzsysteme sind außerdem für ihre Funktionalität auf die dauerhafte Beobachtung des häuslichen Umfelds angewiesen. Die Reflexion der NutzerInnen über dieses „Mithören“, das im öffentlichen Diskurs teilweise sehr kritisch betrachtet wird, steht ebenfalls im Fokus der im Projekt durchgeführten Untersuchungen. Im Rahmen der hier vorgestellten Pilotstudie werden methodische Prämissen im Hinblick auf das Vorgehen bei der Datenerhebung reflektiert und aus den gewonnenen Daten erste Anhaltspunkte für die sprachwissenschaftlichen Analysekategorien herauskristallisiert. Der Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf der Identifikation von sprachlich-interaktionalen Praktiken und deren Einbettung in soziokulturelle Praktiken, die in der Hauptstudie ebenfalls näher beleuchtet werden sollen. Unsere Daten zeigen, dass Interagierende ein Sprachassistenzsystem nicht wie einen zusätzlichen Gesprächsteilnehmer in die Interaktion einbeziehen, sondern es durchaus wie ein technisches Gerät behandeln. Gleichzeitig scheint die parallele Nutzung des medial mündlichen Kanals zur Bedienung eines Geräts auf der einen und zum Führen einer Konversation auf der anderen Seite Auswirkungen auf das Repertoire sprachlich-interaktionaler sowie kultureller Praktiken zu haben.},

  abstract = {Africa is currently the fastest-urbanizing continent in the world. As part of this rapid growth, New Towns are increasingly employed by private developers as a means of providing well-serviced urban environments to middle- and upper-income groups. These comprehensively-planned New Towns are often seen in contrast to the perceived ‘chaos’ and ‘congestion’ of large African cities. As a result, two urban forms, the highly controlled New Towns and the unregulated settlements at their edges, engage in complex social and economic exchanges, but remain spatially segregated and socially exclusive. Current research points to the need for an alternative approach to top-down New Town planning in Africa. Participatory workshops are one alternative that can offer planners access to local knowledge that is otherwise difficult to access. This paper explores the potential of short-term reflective, design, and serious gaming workshops by reflecting on the experiences of the authors in four recent workshops. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of these workshops as useful tools to increase inclusivity in African New Towns by bringing together stakeholders with competing agendas and supporting open discussion, negotiation, and informed decision-making. The paper concludes that participation from stakeholder groups that would normally be marginalized from the planning process (such as current residents, temporary users, and residents of adjacent unregulated communities), can offer new insights to planning bodies and inform more inclusive New Towns across the continent.},

  abstract = {It is striking that designers often speak of the spirit of good design. That spirit is the decisive goal of designers yet it escapes definition, description and often evades discussion. This chapter is a meditation on the complex interaction between design and animism. First, an exploration of what is commonly known as animism is required, for the difference between animism and post-animism has only little to do with the belief in the life of things, and actually, is a severely outdated construct of the 19th century. Second, the current discussion on animistic epistemologies is reviewed in order to further clarify the term and to enable a more inclusive and relational discourse for product design theory. Third, some evolutionary considerations are dedicated to the question of cognitive epistemologies in general and whether or not humans are innately animistic, specifically. Finally, purposeful animism – the idea of designing animistic relationships between objects and users of objects – is explored. Here emotional durability as a design direction is addressed since it seeks to create stronger emotionality and enduring interaction with things, which in turn can lead to a more sustainable use of resources. Things regarded as housing a spirit – it is assumed here – are more likely to be revered and protected.},

  abstract = {This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an openended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice assistants allow users to control appliances and functions of a smart home by simply uttering a few words. Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants’ actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. Objective: The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). Methods: A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11). Conclusions: Users with motor, linguistic, and cognitive impairments can effectively interact with voice assistants, given specific levels of residual cognitive and linguistic skills. More specifically, our paper advances practical indicators to predict the level of accessibility of speech-based interactive systems. Finally, accessibility design guidelines are introduced based on the performance results observed in users with disabilities.},

  abstract = {We present results from a mixed methods study of screen reader use and switching behavior among people with vision impairments in India. We examine loyalty and experimentation with screen readers and find that the main drivers of adoption for early users differ significantly from the factors that drive continued use by advanced users. We discuss the factor that emerges as one of the strongest stated drivers of early adoption, text-to-speech “voice” quality, particularly a “human-sounding voice” as one of the key features differentiating free/open source products from more expensive proprietary products. While the initial preferences are driven by voice quality, application support becomes more important over time as users speed up their sound settings and become more comfortable with the resultant non-human-sounding speech. We discuss these findings from two theoretical perspectives—first, through the application of the economics of behavior switching, and second, vis-à-vis novice and expert approaches toward new product adoption. We argue that these findings further our understanding of initial user comfort related to assistive technology adoption, and the impact of early technology choices on long-term technology switching behavior.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of AI systems and applications in our everyday lives, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration while designing and engineering these types of systems. Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

  abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See “Turning Point” in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

A literature review illustrated that workshops are discussed according to three different perspectives: workshops as a means, workshops as practice, and workshops as a research methodology. Focusing primarily on the latter, this paper presents five studies on upper secondary and higher education teachers’ professional development and on teaching and learning through video conferencing. Through analysis and discussion of these studies’ findings, we argue that workshops provide a platform that can aid researchers in identifying and exploring relevant factors in a given domain by providing means for understanding complex work and knowledge processes that are supported by technology (for example, e-learning). The approach supports identifying factors that are not obvious to either the participants or the researchers prior to commencing the workshop process. This paper also discusses the facilitator’s different clinical and ethnographic roles and highlights the risks and ethical issues involved during both the workshop process and the workshop data analysis. As such, these collaborative and immersive aspects frame workshops as a research approach that has the potential to advance meaning negotiation between researchers and participants.},

Workshops unite stakeholders in the utilization of participatory methods, coalescing in the best possible creative solutions. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify design approaches whilst providing guidance to health information technology designers/researchers in devising and organizing workshops. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in five medical/library databases identifying 568 articles. The initial duplication removal resulted in 562 articles. A criteria-based screening of the title field, abstracts, and pre-full-texts reviews resulted in 72 records for full-text review. The final review resulted in 10 article exclusions. Results: 62 publications were included in the review. These studies focused on consumer facing and clinical health information technologies. The studied technologies involved both clinician and patients and encompassed an array of health conditions. Diverse workshop activities and deliverables were reported. Only seven publications reported workshop evaluation data. Discussion: This systematic review focused on workshops as a design and research activity in the health informatics domain. Our review revealed three themes: (1) There are a variety of ways of conducting design workshops; (2) Workshops are effective design and research approaches; (3) Various levels of workshop details were reported.},

  abstract = {Purpose of the paper: The increasing consumer adoption of voice-based artificial intelligence technologies is starting to catch the attention of researchers. This study fits into the nascent marketing literature on user perceptions of interactions with voice assistants (VAs) by exploring perceived VA anthropomorphism and benefits. We also seek to identify millennial clusters based on perceptual differences. Methodology: Quantitative exploratory research was conducted based on questionnaires (N=337) administered to millennials. The data were analysed through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, to identify clusters, we performed K-means cluster analysis. Findings: The EFA indicated a four-factor solution: “utilitarian and hedonic benefits”, “symbolic benefits”, “human-like voice” and “human-like presence”. The K-means cluster analysis identified three clusters: “useful and pleasant”, “human” and “status symbol”. Research limits: This paper is not exempt from limitations, especially those related to the exploratory nature of the analysis techniques adopted. Practical implications: Indicating the main perceptual dimensions of VA anthropomorphism and the benefits associated with user-VA interaction, our results provide marketers with important strategic implications for designing the VA interaction experience. The cluster analysis offers companies the possibility of selecting a target and addressing it by creating a specific value proposition. Originality of the paper: This study contributes to the existing partial and fragmented knowledge by offering an overall integrated interpretation of consumer perceptions related to VA interactions. Our findings are the first to jointly reveal user perceptions of the human voice and of the VA as a human interlocutor. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on anthropomorphism by conceptualising the human-like voice construct.},

We discuss the tangle of practical and nonfunctional needs that characterize the experience of users at home in an ampler way, aiming at effective wellbeing. To synthesize the results of ethnography, we introduce the concept of resilience in domestic environment arguing that, in the design of solutions for home automation, we must consider home as a dynamic place, apt to support the continuous change of needs and lifestyles of users.},

  abstract = {With the development of deep connections between humans and Artificial Intelligence voice-based assistants (VAs), human and machine relationships have transformed. For relationships to work it is essential for trust to be established. Although the capabilities of VAs offer retailers and consumers enhanced opportunities, building trust with machines is inherently challenging. In this paper, we propose integrating Human–Computer Interaction Theories and Para-Social Relationship Theory to develop insight into how trust and attitudes toward VAs are established. By adopting a mixed-method approach, first, we quantitatively examine the proposed model using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling on 466 respondents; based on the findings of this study, a second qualitative study is employed to reveal four main themes. Findings show that while functional elements drive users' attitude toward using VAs, the social attributes, being social presence and social cognition, are the unique antecedents for developing trust. Additionally, the research illustrates a peculiar dynamic between privacy and trust and it shows how users distinguish two different sources of trustworthiness in their interactions with VAs, identifying the brand producers as the data collector. Taken together, these results reinforce the idea that individuals interact with VAs treating them as social entities and employing human social rules, thus supporting the adoption of a para-social perspective.},

The first, broader study is a content analysis of 346 Amazon Echo reviews that include users with disabilities, while the second study more specifically focuses on users with visual impairments, through interviews with 16 current users of home-based IPAs. Findings show that, although some accessibility challenges exist, users with a range of disabilities are using the Amazon Echo, including for unexpected cases such as speech therapy and support for caregivers. Richer voice-based applications and solutions to support discoverability would be particularly useful to users with visual impairments. These findings should inform future work on accessible voice-based IPAs.},

Over the past forty years, designers have privileged human values such that human-centered design is seen as progressive. Yet because all that is not human has been depleted, made extinct, or put to human use, today's design contributes to the existential threat of climate change and the ongoing extinctions of other species. In Things We Could Design, Ron Wakkary argues that human-centered design is not the answer to our problems but is itself part of the problem. Drawing on philosophy, design theory, and numerous design works, he shows the way to a relational and expansive design based on humility and cohabitation. Wakkary says that design can no longer ignore its exploitation of nonhuman species and the materials we mine for and reduce to human use. Posthumanism, he argues, enables a rethinking of design that displaces the human at the center of thought and action. Weaving together posthumanist philosophies with design, he describes what he calls things—nonhumans made by designers—and calls for a commitment to design with more than human participation. Wakkary also focuses on design as “nomadic practices”—a multiplicity of intentionalities and situated knowledges that shows design to be expansive and pluralistic. He calls his overall approach “designing-with”: the practice of design in a world in which humans share center stage with nonhumans, and in which we are bound together materially, ethically, and existentially.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.},

These findings lead us to propose four design implications that we argue could increase people’s enthusiasm for smart home technologies.},

  abstract = {Universal design is the design of buildings, products or environments to make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. The term "universal design" was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb – now a standard feature of the built environment. Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.},

  abstract = {For over 20 years, the concept of the virtual has prevailed in French digital studies. Yet two decades of daily cultural integration with interfaces have demonstrated that virtuality is only one of many aspects of our interactive experience with digital devices. A need therefore exists for new concepts more apt to address the philosophical complexity of the digital phenomenon and the signi cance of our interactions with calculated matter as they are true existential experiences of phenomenological signi cance. In this chapter I explain why I have suggested introducing the phenomenological concept of ontophany (manifestation of being). In close relationship with a comprehensive and broadened understanding of Bachelard’s notion of “phenomenotechnique,” I examine the hitherto unidenti ed technicality of this manifestation process. Prior to their existence as tools in uses, technologies are rst the perceptual structure of our existence; they are the “devices” or the invisible matrixes, produced by culture and history, into which our potential experience-ofthe-world is cast. Not only do the following theoretical propositions seek to contribute, philosophically, to Internet Studies and to a better understanding the Digital Age, they also hope to give rise to a broader deliberation on technology and perception, as they relate to an approach I would characterize as a historical phenomenology of technology.},

"once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the way in which it will design the actions of its users, according to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used — here we can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects as having 'horizons of use', similar to Gadamer's notion of interpretation as 'an interaction between the horizon provided by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to it'.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological designing process.[14]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})

"The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological designing could be seen as equivalent to 'environmental determinism', carrying no more agency than 'influence' (as in 'the influence of environment upon individuals', where neither what constitutes environment nor what kind of action 'influence' is, are ever spelt out)."

"Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it's held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the interpretation didn't start from ground zero, from a position of absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement which carried with it a particular understanding of the functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the thing itself."

"The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the emphasis is read — if 'designed for' is read as 'allowed for' this would suggest that the occupants' journey though time also had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling."

"the jug achieves its thinging through its emptiness, through the nothingness that is its centre. The jug gathers liquid, and if the liquid is wine, it also gathers the sun that shines and the water that falls upon the earth and nurtures the vine from which the wine is made.

\par
"Our worlding, then, could be thought of as an induction into the intentions of things. And in our technological society, more and more of the things of our world have a strongly intentional; more than this, an instrumental character, thus their designing power over us intensifies. This is true for both, but in different ways, single function objects (e.g. a lawnmower, a gadget) and complex multifunctional system-things such as computers, which rather than inducting us into a world of multiple creative possibilities (as software advertisers would have it), design us as users into their horizons of possibility — which by the very nature of horizons (in Gadamer's sense) always have a limit."

"It includes the designing of design processes, whereby outcomes are prefigured by the processes deployed and where-in the activation of particular design processes inscribe within designers particular ways of working.

"ontological designing is a way of characterising the relation between human beings and lifeworlds." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=1}{Willis 2006:69})
\par
"• that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; • that designing is fundamental to being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); • that this adds up to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=1}{Willis 2006:69})

"a hermeneutics of design concerned with the nature and of the agency of design, which understands design as a subject-decentred practice, acknowledging that things as well as people design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=2}{Willis 2006:70})
\par
"ontology refers to enquiry of what is, while ontological refers to the condition or behaviour of what is" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=2}{Willis 2006:70})

\par
"Bringing into presence' refers to the human activity of giving meaning to 'what is'." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=2}{Willis 2006:70})
\par
"human access to 'what is' can never be direct and unmediated, but is always interpretative." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=2}{Willis 2006:70})
\par
"knowledge comes to be inscribed by being with the 'designing-being' of a tool , this in turn modifying (designing) the being of the tool-user." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"the mental prefiguration of what is to be made and the pattern or template that guides making." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the way in which it will design the actions of its users, according to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used — here we can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects as having 'horizons of use', similar to Gadamer's notion of interpretation as 'an interaction between the horizon provided by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to it'.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological designing process.[14]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological designing could be seen as equivalent to 'environmental determinism', carrying no more agency than 'influence' (as in 'the influence of environment upon individuals', where neither what constitutes environment nor what kind of action 'influence' is, are ever spelt out)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"Yet to make a material/non-material distinction for ontological designing is" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"partly to miss the point" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=4}{Willis 2006:72})
\par
"Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it's held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the interpretation didn't start from ground zero, from a position of absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement which carried with it a particular understanding of the functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the thing itself." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=4}{Willis 2006:72})
\par
"(i) we are born into and come to be human in language; (ii) we appropriate it, modify it, perhaps put words together in ways that they have not been combined before, encounter new situations which require new words; (iii) thus in appropriating language we also change it, and language-as-changed in turn acts back on us as language users.[18]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"the human being is human only by virtue of existing in a worlded condition, that is to say, the human being dwells amongst entities which become present as entities only through engaged dealings-with, including the inescapable mediation of language" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"worlds, are always circumscribed, situated, and multiple" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"Worldhood is much stronger than the more commonplace notion of 'world view', which retains the Cartesian divide between observer and observed, 'view' suggesting a consciously self-selected vantage point" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"Conceptually, worldhood provides the setting for understanding the operation of ontological designing — which can here be renamed as worlding." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"the idea of worlding refuses 'human' and 'world' as separate or self-contained entities" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"Ontological designing is a way of naming particular situated instances of worlding." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})
\par
"The worlding of equipment in Being and Time could be restated as equipment's ontological designing of the user of equipment." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=6}{Willis 2006:74})
\par
"The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the emphasis is read — if 'designed for' is read as 'allowed for' this would suggest that the occupants' journey though time also had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=7}{Willis 2006:75})
\par
"But choosing to read 'designed for' more actively implies an intentional spatial, artefactual designing of the journey of life — which could be seen as the fundamental activity of all cultures." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=7}{Willis 2006:75})
\par
"This covering over of being also means that we no longer know how to dwell among things" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=7}{Willis 2006:75})
\par
"Encountering the concrete things of everyday life has been put forward as significant for the forming of human beings' 'pre-ontological' understanding, which in turn has been posited as a more fundamental kind of understanding than that of rational, conscious thought."

"Our worlding, then, could be thought of as an induction into the intentions of things. And in our technological society, more and more of the things of our world have a strongly intentional; more than this, an instrumental character, thus their designing power over us intensifies. This is true for both, but in different ways, single function objects (e.g. a lawnmower, a gadget) and complex multifunctional system-things such as computers, which rather than inducting us into a world of multiple creative possibilities (as software advertisers would have it), design us as users into their horizons of possibility — which by the very nature of horizons (in Gadamer's sense) always have a limit."

  abstract = {This paper illuminates how gendered stereotypes can be leveraged to assuage anxieties surrounding artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VA). In particular, the analysis shows that these AI objects routinely traffic in normative gender roles of the feminine as caretaker, mother, and wife in order to obfuscate modes of surveillance, and mediate the relationship users and potential users have with late-capitalist market logics in the platform economy. Mobilizing essentialist feminine personas characterized in this paper as “digital domesticity,” artificially intelligent objects orient users to engage productively with surveillance capitalism as natural. To illustrate this relationship between femininity and surveillance, this paper focuses on two case studies of AI VA. The essay turns to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa as emblematic of AI VA that perform a stereotypically feminine persona that invites users to participate in increasingly intimate forms of data exchange that in turn contribute to surveillance capitalism. The study of AI VA, like Siri and Alexa, demonstrates the significant rhetorical capacities of the feminine persona as they are applied to objects with weak (that is, limited) artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Background: A voice assistant (VA) is inanimate audio-interfaced software augmented with artificial intelligence, capable of 2-way dialogue, and increasingly used to access health care advice. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common perinatal mood disorder with an annual estimated cost of \$14.2 billion. Only a small percentage of PPD patients seek care due to lack of screening and insufficient knowledge of the disease, and this is, therefore, a prime candidate for a VA-based digital health intervention. Objective: In order to understand the capability of VAs, our aim was to assess VA responses to PPD questions in terms of accuracy, verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice given. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined four VAs (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana) installed on two mobile devices in early 2020. We posed 14 questions to each VA that were retrieved from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) patient-focused Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on PPD. We scored the VA responses according to accuracy of speech recognition, presence of a verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice in accordance with ACOG FAQ, which were assessed by two board-certified physicians. Results: Accurate recognition of the query ranged from 79\% to 100\%. Verbal response ranged from 36\% to 79\%. If no verbal response was given, queries were treated like a web search between 33\% and 89\% of the time. Clinically appropriate advice given by VA ranged from 14\% to 29\%. We compared the category proportions using the Fisher exact test. No single VA statistically outperformed other VAs in the three performance categories. Additional observations showed that two VAs (Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) included advertisements in their responses. Conclusions: While the best performing VA gave clinically appropriate advice to 29\% of the PPD questions, all four VAs taken together achieved 64\% clinically appropriate advice. All four VAs performed well in accurately recognizing a PPD query, but no VA achieved even a 30\% threshold for providing clinically appropriate PPD information. Technology companies and clinical organizations should partner to improve guidance, screen patients for mental health disorders, and educate patients on potential treatment.},

We hypothesized that excessive object attachment is an attempt to compensate for unmet relatedness needs. We tested this hypothesis in two studies by examining whether object attachment mediates the relationship between loneliness and HD using bootstrapped multiple regression analyses in a community sample (Study 1; n = 213) and an undergraduate sample of individuals with high hoarding symptoms (Study 2: n = 91). Participants in both studies completed self-report measures of loneliness, object attachment, and hoarding symptoms. Study 2 also accounted for the possible confounding effects of age and depressive symptoms. Results from both studies showed that loneliness and object attachment were positively associated with HD symptoms. Study 1 showed that object attachment mediated the relationship between loneliness and HD symptoms, and Study 2 showed a significant mediation even after accounting for age and depression. Results provide justification for further experimental and longitudinal research into loneliness as both a cause and consequence of object attachment and HD. Further investigation may be warranted into the possibility that addressing loneliness in HD might result in lower object attachment.},

  abstract = {Children’s play objects are increasingly shaped by technological innovations that can transform them into hybrid, internet-connected toys, a phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Toys. Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R\&D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},

"children ascribe human and life-like qualities to inanimate object like robots, including cognitive, behavioral, and especially affective characteristics.

"Analysis The analysis can be considered as a particular type of expert evaluation, complementing (not replacing) user and technical research.

\par
"In the first analysis phase, we explored each design concept from the perspective of animistic design, questioning whether and how the design qualities would foster or inhibit 1) agency, 2) embodiment, 3) a certain ecology of objects and subjects, and 4) uncertainty (cf., supra). Based on the analytical lens of agency, we defined new codes relating to 'autonomy', 'domination, 'simulation', and 'negotiation'. The combination of the perspective of agency with the notion of an ecology, led to the definition of the following new codes: '(in)dependence', and 'divergent interactions'. The analytical lens of embodiment and ecology led to an investigation and discussion of 'boundaries' in the connected toys concepts. The notion of uncertainty did not yield new codes during the analysis, but was helpful to further characterize and flesh out each of the new codes presented above."

"The Bracelet concept hinted upon several animistic design principles in affording children to interact with it in an ecology of heterogeneous, tangible, networked objects that act upon each other in uncertain ways. It does not rely on the typical command and response pattern present in traditional user-interface interactions. It is indeed an essential characteristic of animistic design "to fit a messy, serendipitous process of constant reassessment, enriching open-ended situations" [3:2255]. The meaning of the Bracelet is incomplete when children do not co-construct its significance, which signifies the embodied nature of animistic design and echoes [23:228] statement that agency in animistic designs is not something that objects have, but only exists in relation to its user(s) or in its encounters with other things and data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})
\par
"We do note, however, that design qualities can afford an animistic interpretation, but even without these qualities being present, children still have the agency to creatively bring these objects to live." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})

"Future studies on animistic design could then consider triangulating data in a research design that combines adult expert evaluations of the design qualities with an analysis of empirical data based on participation of children and parents. Doing so would allow us to actually treat the human and non-human activities on an equal stand, which is a key characteristic of animistic design, and posthumanist research in general."
