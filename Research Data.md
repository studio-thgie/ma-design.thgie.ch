# Research Data
The interviews and observations are among the core data which was also extensively analysed through [Thematic Analysis](output/Thematic%20Analysis.md).

- [Interviews](data/Interviews.md) and their transcripts
- [Participatory Observations](data/Participatory%20Observations.md) 

Further data that underlined certain aspects of the analysis are as follows.

- [Photographic Observations](data/Photographic%20Observations.md)
- [Prototyping I](journal/Prototyping%20I.md)
- [Expert Workshop I](research/designs/Expert%20Workshop%20I.md)

## Additional Data
The experience reports did not go directly into the [Thematic Analysis](output/Thematic%20Analysis.md), but they were informative of certain language patterns. As such I kept it here. There list of participants is anonymised. That collection hold together certain data points, such as different observations and interviews with the same person.
