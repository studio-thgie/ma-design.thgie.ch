        <p>“ontological designing is a way of characterising the
        relation between human beings and lifeworlds.” (Willis
        2006:69)</p>
        <p>“• that design is something far more pervasive and profound
        than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists,
        philosophers or lay persons; • that designing is fundamental to
        being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and
        scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn
        we are designed by our designing and by that which we have
        designed (i.e., through our interactions with the structural and
        material specificities of our environments); • that this adds up
        to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts
        back on us and designs us.” (Willis 2006:69)</p>
        <p>“a hermeneutics of design concerned with the nature and of
        the agency of design, which understands design as a
        subject-decentred practice, acknowledging that things as well as
        people design” (Willis 2006:70)</p>
        <p>“ontology refers to enquiry of what is, while ontological
        refers to the condition or behaviour of what is” (Willis
        2006:70)</p>
        <p>“F” (Willis 2006:70)</p>
        <p>“or Heidegger, being-in-the-world is grounded, situated,
        always already caught up with the concerns of the world and with
        doing.” (Willis 2006:70)</p>
        <p>“Bringing into presence’ refers to the human activity of
        giving meaning to ‘what is’.” (Willis 2006:70)</p>
        <p>“human access to ‘what is’ can never be direct and
        unmediated, but is always interpretative.” (Willis 2006:70)</p>
        <p>“knowledge comes to be inscribed by being with the
        ‘designing-being’ of a tool , this in turn modifying (designing)
        the being of the tool-user.” (Willis 2006:71)</p>
        <p>“the mental prefiguration of what is to be made and the
        pattern or template that guides making.” (Willis 2006:71)</p>
        <p>“once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the
        way in which it will design the actions of its users, according
        to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used — here we
        can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects
        as having ‘horizons of use’, similar to Gadamer’s notion of
        interpretation as ‘an interaction between the horizon provided
        by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to
        it’.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological
        designing process.[14]” (Willis 2006:71)</p>
        <p>“The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological
        designing could be seen as equivalent to ‘environmental
        determinism’, carrying no more agency than ‘influence’ (as in
        ‘the influence of environment upon individuals’, where neither
        what constitutes environment nor what kind of action ‘influence’
        is, are ever spelt out).” (Willis 2006:71)</p>
        <p>“Yet to make a material/non-material distinction for
        ontological designing is” (Willis 2006:71)</p>
        <p>“partly to miss the point” (Willis 2006:72)</p>
        <p>“Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday
        situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has
        to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding
        of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to
        use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very
        likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it’s
        held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the
        interpretation didn’t start from ground zero, from a position of
        absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement
        which carried with it a particular understanding of the
        functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space
        for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the
        thing itself.” (Willis 2006:72)</p>
        <p>“(i) we are born into and come to be human in language; (ii)
        we appropriate it, modify it, perhaps put words together in ways
        that they have not been combined before, encounter new
        situations which require new words; (iii) thus in appropriating
        language we also change it, and language-as-changed in turn acts
        back on us as language users.[18]” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“the human being is human only by virtue of existing in a
        worlded condition, that is to say, the human being dwells
        amongst entities which become present as entities only through
        engaged dealings-with, including the inescapable mediation of
        language” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“worlds, are always circumscribed, situated, and multiple”
        (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“Worldhood is much stronger than the more commonplace notion
        of ‘world view’, which retains the Cartesian divide between
        observer and observed, ‘view’ suggesting a consciously
        self-selected vantage point” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“Conceptually, worldhood provides the setting for
        understanding the operation of ontological designing — which can
        here be renamed as worlding.” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“the idea of worlding refuses ‘human’ and ‘world’ as separate
        or self-contained entities” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“Ontological designing is a way of naming particular situated
        instances of worlding.” (Willis 2006:73)</p>
        <p>“The worlding of equipment in Being and Time could be
        restated as equipment’s ontological designing of the user of
        equipment.” (Willis 2006:74)</p>
        <p>“The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the
        emphasis is read — if ‘designed for’ is read as ‘allowed for’
        this would suggest that the occupants’ journey though time also
        had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the
        (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling.” (Willis
        2006:75)</p>
        <p>“But choosing to read ‘designed for’ more actively implies an
        intentional spatial, artefactual designing of the journey of
        life — which could be seen as the fundamental activity of all
        cultures.” (Willis 2006:75)</p>
        <p>“This covering over of being also means that we no longer
        know how to dwell among things” (Willis 2006:75)</p>
        <p>“Encountering the concrete things of everyday life has been
        put forward as significant for the forming of human beings’
        ‘pre-ontological’ understanding, which in turn has been posited
        as a more fundamental kind of understanding than that of
        rational, conscious thought.” (Willis 2006:75)</p>
        <p>Does Heidegger dabble in psychological aspects? (note on
        p.75)</p>
        <p>“If we pervade buildings, they also pervade us — entrances,
        corridors, stairs, lifts, large rooms, small rooms — all design
        our modes of spatial occupation and our movements through
        spaces, allowing some, not allowing others. While we as humans
        design buildings, they also design us.” (Willis 2006:76)</p>
        <p>“they are designed to design by the specific ways in which
        they incorporate dwelling.” (Willis 2006:76)</p>
        <p>“the imagined object or place can be considered not as a
        representation in the mind but as a pervasion.” (Willis
        2006:76)</p>
        <p>“While the examples of spatialised dwelling and of the
        operation of memory and daydreaming indicate that ontological
        designing cannot be restricted to ‘being with the material
        world’ there are many other orders and domains of immaterial
        pervasion, and therefore of immaterial ontological designing —
        one of the most significant being the televisual.” (Willis
        2006:76)</p>
        <p>“the jug achieves its thinging through its emptiness, through
        the nothingness that is its centre. The jug gathers liquid, and
        if the liquid is wine, it also gathers the sun that shines and
        the water that falls upon the earth and nurtures the vine from
        which the wine is made. In its holding, the jug thus performs a
        profound gathering, which is also a giving, for the jug is also
        designed for outpouring. Its outpouring quenches thirst, its
        outpouring is a gift: in the gift of water, in the gift of wine,
        sky and earth dwell. But the gift of the outpouring is what
        makes the jug a jug. In the jugness of the jug, sky and earth
        dwell.[TT, 172]” (Willis 2006:77)</p>
        <p>“The juice box (along with other kinds of packaged take-away
        food) designs eating and drinking as an individualised, rather
        than communal activity.” (Willis 2006:78)</p>
        <p>“The jug and the juice box are literally worlds apart, and so
        to is their worlding. Heidegger’s jug is located in (an
        idealised) pre-modern culture of crafted artefacts made from
        earth, a world of direct connection between the nurturer of the
        fruit, the earth in which it grows, the spread on the table and
        of giving thanks to the divinities. The juice box on the office
        worker’s desk sits within a totally desacralised,
        instrumentalised culture of convenience where a worker’s
        productivity has nothing to do with soil, rain and the bounty of
        the gods, and everything to do with de-materialised output of
        electronic work and production, which has no place for the
        gathering of eating, only for the sustenance of working bodies
        which can be conveniently met by products like singleserve juice
        boxes.” (Willis 2006:78)</p>
        <p>“Ontological designing happens whether the perceiving subject
        (who is the subject of, as in subjected to, the designed) is
        aware of it or not.” (Willis 2006:79)</p>
        <p>“Once ontological designing is allowed to perform its
        unconcealment, once the idea is appropriated — i.e., that things
        have the capacity to ‘thing’, a different kind of designing
        becomes possible. Designing with knowledge of the thinging of
        things will be qualitatively different from any kind of
        designing which does not know this.” (Willis 2006:79)</p>
        <p>“Thus a” (Willis 2006:79)</p>
        <p>“move can be made from ontological designing as the naming of
        something to ontological design as practice. This too makes
        ontological designing available as a practice towards social
        change.” (Willis 2006:80)</p>
        <p>“Designing no matter which aspect or at what stage, is always
        more than conscious decisionism” (Willis 2006:80)</p>
        <p>“An ontological understanding of design brings to light the
        multiple, complex and ongoing worlding of design.” (Willis
        2006:80)</p>
        <p>“1. as it applies to conventionally considered designed
        things — e.g., buildings, manufactured objects 2. extending on
        from this there is the ontological designing of material and
        immaterial infrastructure, of e.g. management systems, of
        information technologies, of communication systems, and then
        there is, 3. the ontological designing of systems of thought, of
        habits of mind.” (Willis 2006:80)</p>
        <p>“To assert ‘we are all designed’ does not mean universal
        uniformity for as Dasein (‘being-here’) ‘we are’ designed in the
        specificity of the differences of our lifeworlds;
        ‘being-designed’ and ‘being-here’ (Dasein) thus are
        interconnected.” (Willis 2006:81)</p>
        <p>“Design could be thought of as embedding of intention
        (intention here understood as ‘directing-itself-towards’) —
        which is another way of stating the thinging of things.” (Willis
        2006:81)</p>
        <p>“Our worlding, then, could be thought of as an induction into
        the intentions of things. And in our technological society, more
        and more of the things of our world have a strongly intentional;
        more than this, an instrumental character, thus their designing
        power over us intensifies. This is true for both, but in
        different ways, single function objects (e.g. a lawnmower, a
        gadget) and complex multifunctional system-things such as
        computers, which rather than inducting us into a world of
        multiple creative possibilities (as software advertisers would
        have it), design us as users into their horizons of possibility
        — which by the very nature of horizons (in Gadamer’s sense)
        always have a limit.” (Willis 2006:81)</p>
        <p>“1. the design object — the material or immaterial outcome of
        designing 2. the design process — the system, organisation,
        conduct and activity of designing 3. the design agency — the
        designer, design instruction in any medium or mode of expression
        and the designed object itself as it acts on its world.[40]”
        (Willis 2006:83)</p>
        <p>“There needs to be something which is fundamental to all
        three” (Willis 2006:83)</p>
        <p>“Thinking design ontologically provides this because it
        implies being-in-the world as a condition which is always
        already situated” (Willis 2006:83)</p>
        <p>“The ontological claim that ‘design designs’ (Fry’s
        formulation) is a much stronger claim than ‘design affects’ or
        ‘has an influence on’.” (Willis 2006:84)</p>
        <p>“It includes the designing of design processes, whereby
        outcomes are prefigured by the processes deployed and where-in
        the activation of particular design processes inscribe within
        designers particular ways of working. ‘Design designs’ also
        includes the designing effects of that which designers design
        (objects, spaces, systems, infrastructures). The significant
        point here is that all these designings are of the same order.”
        (Willis 2006:84)</p>
        <p>“Traditionally agency has been posited with the designer —
        the assumption being that the designer’s intentions are embedded
        within the designed object which then causes the object’s user
        to do things in certain ways.” (Willis 2006:84)</p>
        <p>“Once the comfortable fiction of an originary human agent
        evaporates, the inscriptive power of the designed is revealed
        and stands naked.” (Willis 2006:84)</p>
