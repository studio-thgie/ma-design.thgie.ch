        <p>“Another sign of popular resistance is increasing
        disenchantment with the consumer lifestyle itself: other
        conceptions of the”good life” are gaining hold, and affluence is
        now commonly seen as compromised by 3 stress, time-scarcity, air
        pollution, traffic congestion, obesity, and general ill health.
        In other words, consumerism is now questioned not only because
        of its ethical and environmental consequences, but also because
        of its negative impact on affluent consumers themselves, and the
        ways in which it compromises both sensual pleasure and more
        spiritual forms of well-being. This questioning underlies the
        many laments for what has gone missing from our lives under the
        pressure of neoliberal economic policies, and also the frequent
        expressions of interest in less tangible goods such as more free
        time, better personal relationships, and a slower pace of life.”
        (<a href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=2">Soper
        :2</a>)</p>
        <p>“In other words, a counter-consumerist ethic and politics
        should appeal not only to altruistic compassion and
        environmental concern (as in the case of Fair Trade and ethical
        shopping), but also to the selfregarding gratifications of
        living and consuming differently. It can seek democratic
        anchorage and legitimation in the already existing resistance to
        consumer culture. At a time when some economic 4 theorists
        predict a terminal decline in capitalism’s powers of
        accumulation, and when the environmental obstacles to growth
        appear insuperable, it becomes urgent to renew an earlier
        tradition of positive thinking on the liberation from work, and
        in this way to strengthen an alternative hedonist defense of the
        pleasures of a less harried and acquisitive way of living.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=4">Soper
        :4</a>)</p>
        <p>“a sense of a world too cluttered and encumbered by material
        objects and sunk in waste, of priorities skewed through the
        focus on ever-more extensive acquisition of stuff.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=5">Soper
        :5</a>)</p>
        <p>“. A good part of our collective productivity is devoted to
        servicing a material culture of ever-faster turnovers and
        built-in obsolescence, which preempts more enjoyable and
        enduring forms of human fulfillment.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=7">Soper
        :7</a>)</p>
        <p>“Many social theorists, including some who take a pretty
        positive view of consumerism, doubt the directness of its
        gratifications, and analyze it instead as compensation or
        substitution for other losses. They see it, in other words, as
        reconciling us to deprivation and alienation rather than as
        intrinsically satisfying — a view echoed in the less erudite
        recommendations of shopping as 8”retail therapy.”” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=8">Soper
        :8</a>)</p>
        <p>“Sustainable alternatives would also have to provide for
        distinctively human forms of need, and meet our appetite for
        novelty, excitement, distraction, self-expression, and the
        gratifications of what 10 Rousseau called amour propre, the
        esteem and approval of others we respect. Indeed, the
        alternative hedonist critique is directed more against the
        limited rein given to such appetites in our materialistic
        society than against the culture of desire as such.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=9">Soper
        :9</a>)</p>
        <p>“in none of these cases are they understood to be responsible
        agents who are accountable to the world beyond their immediate
        personal concerns” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=10">Soper
        :10</a>)</p>
        <p>“However, the alternative hedonist approach resists the
        paternalism of earlier leftist opposition to commodification. My
        main focus is neither on consumption as a bid for personal
        distinction, nor on consumption as a relatively unconscious”form
        of life,” but instead on the ways in which a range of
        contemporary consumerist practices, more or less everyday and
        identityoriented, are being brought into question because of
        their environmental consequences, their impact on health, and
        their constraints on sensual enjoyment and more spiritual forms
        of well-being.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=12">Soper
        :12</a>)</p>
        <p>“might, for example, decide to cycle or walk whenever
        possible in order to reduce pollution, noise, and congestion.
        The hedonist aspect of this shift does not lie exclusively in
        the wish to decrease the unpleasant by-products of affluence,
        but also in the intrinsic personal pleasures of consuming
        differently. The cyclist or walker enjoys sensual experiences,
        including those of greeting other cyclists and walkers, that the
        insulated motorist cannot. But these different pleasures
        themselves require and thrive not only on alternative hedonist
        self-policing in car use but also on support for policies that
        restrain it.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=12">Soper
        :12</a>)</p>
        <p>“To defend the progressive dimension of this resistance to
        what passes for progress is not to recommend a more ascetic
        existence. On the contrary, it is to insist on the sensually
        impoverishing and irrational aspects of contemporary consumer
        culture. It is to speak for the forms of happiness that people
        might be able to enjoy were they to opt for an alternative
        economic order. It is to open up a new political imaginary.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=14">Soper
        :14</a>)</p>
        <p>“It is also important to recognize that people
        are”conditional co-operators” who are much likelier to take
        action to combat climate change impacts and conserve resources
        if assured, by democratic voting, that their fellow citizens
        will do the same.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=15">Soper
        :15</a>)</p>
        <p>“Democracy, it seems, very considerably enhances the
        prospects for 19 reciprocal cooperation.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=15">Soper
        :15</a>)</p>
        <p>“Here the importance of revising our thinking on consumption
        and its dependence on popular approval combine to justify an
        alternative hedonist approach to the cultural politics of
        transition” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=16">Soper
        :16</a>)</p>
        <p>“Antiand counter-consumerist pressures such as these remain
        insignificant compared to the mandates for policing consumption
        that will be needed to advance genuine global sustainability.
        But the model of democratic procedure that they instantiate —
        whereby proactive green initiatives encourage emerging
        structures of feeling by providing for alternative experiences —
        can help us envisage the larger-scale shifts that will be
        essential in any transition to a sustainable economic order.”
        (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V2RG6BUK?page=17">Soper
        :17</a>)</p>
        <p>“We can thus see the importance of rendering explicit the
        desires and concerns now implicit in current expressions of
        consumer anxiety. Indeed, this implicit alternative transcends
        and exposes the Janus-faced response of governments that ask the
        public to adopt energy-saving measures and more healthful
        lifestyles, all the while promoting economic policies that
        support the expansion of consumerism. New kinds of individual
        experience — involving new ideas about the aesthetics of
        material culture and the satisfactions it provides, and
        heightened awareness of the potential political power of
        consumption, or non-consumption — might not only hasten the
        introduction of specific policies but also press governments to
        confront their contradictory stance on the growth economy. And
        anything that helps to promote such changes within affluent
        societies will possess wider global relevance, since the
        disproportionately high levels of consumption by the rich is a
        major factor in the deprivations of the world’s poor.” (<a
