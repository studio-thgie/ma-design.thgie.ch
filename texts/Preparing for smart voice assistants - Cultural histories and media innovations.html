        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Smart voice assistants have become popular thanks largely to
        their default naturalistic female voices and helpful personae.
        In this article, we trace changes in robot voices in popular
        culture and explain how this history influenced the voice design
        of smart voice assistants. Our research draws on cultural
        analysis of Hollywood and international films, television and
        literature, and observations from our personal experiences with
        voice assistants. We argue that designers of devices like the
        Google Home and Amazon Echo inherited a cultural imaginary of
        alien and dangerous robots with artificial voices and
        personalities. Manufacturers leveraged techniques of modality,
        personae and invocation and pre-existing social connotations of
        the voice to create positive associations of these devices in
        the home. We conclude by arguing that smart voice assistants are
        new media innovations prepared for consumers through
        pre-domestication and represent an emerging regime of power and
        influence based on technologised voice interaction.</p>

        <p>“We argue that these histories have informed the emerging
        discipline of voice user interface (VUI) design applied in the
        current generation of smart voice assistants on phones and smart
        speakers.” (<a

        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680</a>)</p>
        <p>“At the same time, we analyse the media innovations and
        strategies of United States-based technology firms that prepare
        these devices to support their goals of global expansion.” (<a

        <p>“The use of naturalistic middle-class, female voices and
        personae positions speakers as friendly participants in everyday
        family routines. As argued by Woods (2018), this allays fears of
        surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2018) associated with the
        projects of companies such as Amazon and Google. As we will
        show, this also works within and against a cultural history of
        robot voices that play on the social and gendered connotations
        of voice (Phan, 2017).” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680</a>)</p>
        <p>“We begin by examining the emergence of the VUI as a paradigm
        of human-computer interaction and survey the literature on voice
        assistants and theories of voice and sound. We examine a number
        of archetypes of talking robots and computers from Hollywood and
        international screen culture and explore how these
        manifestations of the cultural imaginary have informed the
        design and cultural reception of smart voice assistants. We
        introduce the concepts of modality, personae and invocation to
        help explain the selections and exclusions in the voice design
        of smart voice assistants, and how these shape user interactions
        in the dominant US smart speaker brands: Amazon, Google and
        Apple. We apply Van Leeuwen’s (1999) concept of modality to show
        that the voices of smart voice assistants are designed to seem
        more naturalistically ‘human’ to avoid the historically negative
        associations with robotic voices and artificial intelligence.
        The personae of voice assistants have equally been engineered to
        adopt norms of gender, race and class to reduce anxieties about
        their potential to exceed their roles as loyal helpers and cross
        the boundary into the monstrous. We also analyse the distinctive
        acts of invocation that characterise these devices as a media
        form (Chesher, 2001, 2004).” (<a

        <p>“We have described this process of managing the meanings of
        the voice and design of these digital assistants as
        pre-domestication” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680</a>)</p>
        <p>“Methodologically, we adopted a cultural history approach
        (Davis, 2009), documenting and analysing synthetic voices in
        cinematic and televisual representations, advertising, technical
        systems and associated documents.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681</a>)</p>
        <p>“We draw on theories of voice, speech acts, orality and media
        (Austin, 1962; Chesher, 2004; Guattari, 1992; Nass and Brave,
        2005; Ong, 1982[1982]; Searle, 1969; Van Leeuwen, 1999) to
        conceptualise and interrogate the technocultural construction of
        voice assistants and VUIs as a new model of humancomputer
        interaction” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681</a>)</p>
        <p>“A driver in the rise of VUIs is the powerful belief that
        speech is the most natural form of human communication” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681</a>)</p>
        <p>“The social character of voice complicates the apparent
        naturalness of voice as a medium of human communication. Voice
        immediately reveals the identity and emotion of the speaker.
        Voices are gendered. They give away ethnic, regional and
        subcultural identity as established in cultural studies,
        sociology and linguistics (Bucholtz and Hall, 2009). They give
        off emotions such as depression, fear or excitement” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=4">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923682</a>)</p>
        <p>“Critical scholarship on smart speakers has focussed on their
        technocultural construction, and particularly the cultivation of
        a female voice and persona as the default. Bergen (2016) points
        out that it is significant that these voices are disembodied and
        ‘devoid of that leaky, emotive quality that we have come to
        associate with the feminine body’ (101). Strengers and Nicholls
        (2017) see the voice assistant as a ‘wife replacement’ (p. 6).
        Woods (2018) argues that invoking stereotypes of caretaker,
        mother and wife softens any anxieties from consumers about the
        surveillant implications and consumerist imperatives of these
        devices and systems. Hui and Leong (2017) argue that the
        mobilisation of anthropomorphism, sociability, convenience and
        humour aims to habituate users to these devices. Phan (2019)
        argues that Alexa is an aestheticisation and decontextualisation
        of the domestic servant. In a ‘Think piece’ in a recent UN
        report (2019) West et al. (2019) argue that companies recognise
        that their voice personae are their representatives, and as such
        need to create a favourable impression. In this context, female
        voices are preferred, but, this ‘has less to do with sound,
        tone, syntax and cadence, than an association with assistance’
        (p. 98). The preference for female voices, he argues, also
        relates to their appeal to the predominantly male (and
        presumably heterosexual) population in the tech industry
        developing these devices.” (<a

        <p>“ne out of control (recalling Frankenstein), and later with
        the military industrial complex. In our review of
        mid-20th-century to early 21st-century Hollywood films, we
        identified a range of dystopian screen narratives that saw the
        masculine robotic voice become menacing and potentially
        violent.” (<a

        <p>“As Sofoulis (2001) explains in her analysis of the Star Trek
        television series, the starship Enterprise functions as a
        technoworld, an ‘agentic and knowing container with various
        maternal qualities, especially life support’ (p. 137). Sofoulis
        points out that the ‘container-mum’ (p. 144) manifests in such
        infrastructural sounds as background hums, high-pitched
        electronic beeps and electronic sounds emitted from onboard
        equipment and displays.” (<a

        <p>“TARS’ dialogue modality adjusts accordingly, which
        illustrates how robots might be designed to be emotionally
        manipulative.” (<a

        <p>“In all these examples, the voice is a crucial vehicle with
        which robots and other speaking machines express and perform a
        persona. The concept of persona, meaning a fictitious character
        identity, has a long history, coming from the Greek word
        ‘prosōpon’ which means mask.” (<a

        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923686</a>)</p>
        <p>“VUI developers adopted this concept after recognising its
        value for getting consumers to identify with their products
        (Nielsen, 2013). As Dasgupta (2018) argues in a VUI textbook, it
        helps in ‘making the interaction easier and more natural’
        (p. 43). These developments, drawing on a rich theatrical and
        literary tradition, have underpinned the shift in the
        representation of the robot towards more complex and sympathetic
        characters with distinct personalities.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=8">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923686</a>)</p>
        <p>“In these cinematic examples, there has been a trend for
        robot voices to change from highly artificial and in low
        modality towards more naturalistic ones. As science fiction
        narratives explored possible worlds in which machines and humans
        would become increasingly indistinguishable, voice assistant
        technologies in the early 21st century were developing higher
        modality voices and personae with personality.” (<a

        <p>“In 2017, Amazon spent US$22.6 billion and Alphabet spent
        US$16.2 billion overall on research and development, of which a
        significant proportion was dedicated to smart voice assistants
        (Loeb, 2018). T” (<a

        <p>“The big tech companies adapted the voices of female voice
        actors as the default voices for their devices. This choice was
        strategic, leveraging the social connotations of the feminine
        voice to produce voice and personae that would appear naturally
        sympathetic and helpful.” (<a

        <p>“The companies assure users that their voice is recorded only
        after the wake-word is detected. This is not merely a
        technicality but part of the social design to create
        intelligible and unthreatening female voices that would also
        guard against the potential for these devices to expose the home
        to hackers, corporations or governments.” (<a

        <p>“These controversies highlight the cultural anxieties and
        tensions that surface when the wake-word proves fallible, and
        the faithful assistant betrays its promised confidentiality.”

        <p>“An interaction with a smart speaker is usefully seen as a
        form of invocation.” (<a

        <p>“As these voices are owned by large corporations, these
        invocational platforms risk reproducing social biases and
        compromising media pluralism and diversity.” (<a

        <p>“In her study of Google Glass, Saariketo (2018), building on
        Silverstone and Haddon’s (1996, 1998) contributions, suggested
        that ‘pre-domestication’ is an important but neglected phase of
        consumption in which ‘people need to be attracted, invited, and
        interpellated to familiarise [sic] with new technology as its
        potential future users’ (p. 1).” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=12">Humphry
        and Chesher 2020:1461444820923690</a>)</p>
        <p>“In addition to the physical design of a device and its media
        representations, which have been the focus of pre-domestication
        before, we argue that the design of the voice in smart
        technologies is also a way the meanings of products are
        articulated. Smart voice assistants are pre-domesticated with
        their pre-packaged default voices, positioning them in the role
        of gendered helpers, with voices that are apparently natural,
        transparent and depoliticised. Through practices in voice design
        using high modality, a warm and smart persona with the
        programmed capacity to respond to invocationary acts, consumers’
        relationships with their smart speakers have been prepared, even
        before they adopt them, in the form of the non-threatening voice
        of the female assistant.” (<a
