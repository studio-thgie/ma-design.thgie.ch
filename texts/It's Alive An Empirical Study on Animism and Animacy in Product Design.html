        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>The attachment people experience towards products has been
        the topic of many studies but very little has been written on
        animism and product attachment. Here it is argued that in order
        to grant a product animated qualities, the user actually
        requires animistic thinking. It is necessary to translate
        perceivable characteristics of animacy into product language.
        This is the basis for empirically testing the mutually dependent
        relationship (of animism and animacy) using six separate
        experiments. The hypotheses to be tested assume that a product
        featuring a defined characteristic is perceived as more alive or
        more animated than the same product lacking such a
        characteristic. It is argued here that more product attachment
        can be achieved not simply through more things “alive” but by
        actually encouraging a new animism.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our modern consumerism leads to shorter lifespans of products
        in most categories since older versions of the products are
        often replaced while still functioning and new products are
        bought following the slogan „the cheaper, the better“. This is
        not only the result of planned obsolescence (Packard 1960), but
        also of obsolescence of desirability. To avoid ecological
        disaster, some approaches have been suggested: The Cradle to
        Cradle concept (McDonough &amp; Braungart 2010, 2013) as well as
        Circular Product Design (Bakker, 2014) are amongst the most
        promising. Although such considerations are indispensable for a
        needed design revolution, this paper argues for more attachment
        to the things we already have. As the things around us become
        “alive”, is it not feasible to expect more emotionality? Thus,
        this paper is influenced by Jonathan Chapman’s theory of
        emotionally durable design where the relationships between the
        consumer and a product are explored (Chapman 2005, 2009,
        2015).</p>
