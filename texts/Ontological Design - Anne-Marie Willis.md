## Extracted Annotations

"ontological designing is a way of characterising the relation between human beings and lifeworlds." (Willis 2006:69)

"• that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; • that designing is fundamental to being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); • that this adds up to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us." (Willis 2006:69)

"a hermeneutics of design concerned with the nature and of the agency of design, which understands design as a subject-decentred practice, acknowledging that things as well as people design" (Willis 2006:70)

"ontology refers to enquiry of what is, while ontological refers to the condition or behaviour of what is" (Willis 2006:70)

"F" (Willis 2006:70)

"or Heidegger, being-in-the-world is grounded, situated, always already caught up with the concerns of the world and with doing." (Willis 2006:70)

"Bringing into presence' refers to the human activity of giving meaning to 'what is'." (Willis 2006:70)

"human access to 'what is' can never be direct and unmediated, but is always interpretative." (Willis 2006:70)

"knowledge comes to be inscribed by being with the 'designing-being' of a tool , this in turn modifying (designing) the being of the tool-user." (Willis 2006:71)

"the mental prefiguration of what is to be made and the pattern or template that guides making." (Willis 2006:71)

"once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the way in which it will design the actions of its users, according to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used — here we can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects as having 'horizons of use', similar to Gadamer's notion of interpretation as 'an interaction between the horizon provided by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to it'.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological designing process.[14]" (Willis 2006:71)

"The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological designing could be seen as equivalent to 'environmental determinism', carrying no more agency than 'influence' (as in 'the influence of environment upon individuals', where neither what constitutes environment nor what kind of action 'influence' is, are ever spelt out)." (Willis 2006:71)

"Yet to make a material/non-material distinction for ontological designing is" (Willis 2006:71)

"partly to miss the point" (Willis 2006:72)

"Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it's held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the interpretation didn't start from ground zero, from a position of absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement which carried with it a particular understanding of the functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the thing itself." (Willis 2006:72)

"(i) we are born into and come to be human in language; (ii) we appropriate it, modify it, perhaps put words together in ways that they have not been combined before, encounter new situations which require new words; (iii) thus in appropriating language we also change it, and language-as-changed in turn acts back on us as language users.[18]" (Willis 2006:73)

"the human being is human only by virtue of existing in a worlded condition, that is to say, the human being dwells amongst entities which become present as entities only through engaged dealings-with, including the inescapable mediation of language" (Willis 2006:73)

"worlds, are always circumscribed, situated, and multiple" (Willis 2006:73)

"Worldhood is much stronger than the more commonplace notion of 'world view', which retains the Cartesian divide between observer and observed, 'view' suggesting a consciously self-selected vantage point" (Willis 2006:73)

"Conceptually, worldhood provides the setting for understanding the operation of ontological designing — which can here be renamed as worlding." (Willis 2006:73)

"the idea of worlding refuses 'human' and 'world' as separate or self-contained entities" (Willis 2006:73)

"Ontological designing is a way of naming particular situated instances of worlding." (Willis 2006:73)

"The worlding of equipment in Being and Time could be restated as equipment's ontological designing of the user of equipment." (Willis 2006:74)

"The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the emphasis is read — if 'designed for' is read as 'allowed for' this would suggest that the occupants' journey though time also had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling." (Willis 2006:75)

"But choosing to read 'designed for' more actively implies an intentional spatial, artefactual designing of the journey of life — which could be seen as the fundamental activity of all cultures." (Willis 2006:75)

"This covering over of being also means that we no longer know how to dwell among things" (Willis 2006:75)

"Encountering the concrete things of everyday life has been put forward as significant for the forming of human beings' 'pre-ontological' understanding, which in turn has been posited as a more fundamental kind of understanding than that of rational, conscious thought." (Willis 2006:75)

Does Heidegger dabble in psychological aspects? (note on p.75)

"If we pervade buildings, they also pervade us — entrances, corridors, stairs, lifts, large rooms, small rooms — all design our modes of spatial occupation and our movements through spaces, allowing some, not allowing others. While we as humans design buildings, they also design us." (Willis 2006:76)

"they are designed to design by the specific ways in which they incorporate dwelling." (Willis 2006:76)

"the imagined object or place can be considered not as a representation in the mind but as a pervasion." (Willis 2006:76)

"While the examples of spatialised dwelling and of the operation of memory and daydreaming indicate that ontological designing cannot be restricted to 'being with the material world' there are many other orders and domains of immaterial pervasion, and therefore of immaterial ontological designing — one of the most significant being the televisual." (Willis 2006:76)

"the jug achieves its thinging through its emptiness, through the nothingness that is its centre. The jug gathers liquid, and if the liquid is wine, it also gathers the sun that shines and the water that falls upon the earth and nurtures the vine from which the wine is made. In its holding, the jug thus performs a profound gathering, which is also a giving, for the jug is also designed for outpouring. Its outpouring quenches thirst, its outpouring is a gift: in the gift of water, in the gift of wine, sky and earth dwell. But the gift of the outpouring is what makes the jug a jug. In the jugness of the jug, sky and earth dwell.[TT, 172]" (Willis 2006:77)

"The juice box (along with other kinds of packaged take-away food) designs eating and drinking as an individualised, rather than communal activity." (Willis 2006:78)

"The jug and the juice box are literally worlds apart, and so to is their worlding. Heidegger's jug is located in (an idealised) pre-modern culture of crafted artefacts made from earth, a world of direct connection between the nurturer of the fruit, the earth in which it grows, the spread on the table and of giving thanks to the divinities. The juice box on the office worker's desk sits within a totally desacralised, instrumentalised culture of convenience where a worker's productivity has nothing to do with soil, rain and the bounty of the gods, and everything to do with de-materialised output of electronic work and production, which has no place for the gathering of eating, only for the sustenance of working bodies which can be conveniently met by products like singleserve juice boxes." (Willis 2006:78)

"Ontological designing happens whether the perceiving subject (who is the subject of, as in subjected to, the designed) is aware of it or not." (Willis 2006:79)

"Once ontological designing is allowed to perform its unconcealment, once the idea is appropriated — i.e., that things have the capacity to 'thing', a different kind of designing becomes possible. Designing with knowledge of the thinging of things will be qualitatively different from any kind of designing which does not know this." (Willis 2006:79)

"Thus a" (Willis 2006:79)

"move can be made from ontological designing as the naming of something to ontological design as practice. This too makes ontological designing available as a practice towards social change." (Willis 2006:80)

"Designing no matter which aspect or at what stage, is always more than conscious decisionism" (Willis 2006:80)

"An ontological understanding of design brings to light the multiple, complex and ongoing worlding of design." (Willis 2006:80)

"1. as it applies to conventionally considered designed things — e.g., buildings, manufactured objects 2. extending on from this there is the ontological designing of material and immaterial infrastructure, of e.g. management systems, of information technologies, of communication systems, and then there is, 3. the ontological designing of systems of thought, of habits of mind." (Willis 2006:80)

"To assert 'we are all designed' does not mean universal uniformity for as Dasein ('being-here') 'we are' designed in the specificity of the differences of our lifeworlds; 'being-designed' and 'being-here' (Dasein) thus are interconnected." (Willis 2006:81)

"Design could be thought of as embedding of intention (intention here understood as 'directing-itself-towards') — which is another way of stating the thinging of things." (Willis 2006:81)

"Our worlding, then, could be thought of as an induction into the intentions of things. And in our technological society, more and more of the things of our world have a strongly intentional; more than this, an instrumental character, thus their designing power over us intensifies. This is true for both, but in different ways, single function objects (e.g. a lawnmower, a gadget) and complex multifunctional system-things such as computers, which rather than inducting us into a world of multiple creative possibilities (as software advertisers would have it), design us as users into their horizons of possibility — which by the very nature of horizons (in Gadamer's sense) always have a limit." (Willis 2006:81)

"1. the design object — the material or immaterial outcome of designing 2. the design process — the system, organisation, conduct and activity of designing 3. the design agency — the designer, design instruction in any medium or mode of expression and the designed object itself as it acts on its world.[40]" (Willis 2006:83)

"There needs to be something which is fundamental to all three" (Willis 2006:83)

"Thinking design ontologically provides this because it implies being-in-the world as a condition which is always already situated" (Willis 2006:83)

"The ontological claim that 'design designs' (Fry's formulation) is a much stronger claim than 'design affects' or 'has an influence on'." (Willis 2006:84)

"It includes the designing of design processes, whereby outcomes are prefigured by the processes deployed and where-in the activation of particular design processes inscribe within designers particular ways of working. 'Design designs' also includes the designing effects of that which designers design (objects, spaces, systems, infrastructures). The significant point here is that all these designings are of the same order." (Willis 2006:84)

"Traditionally agency has been posited with the designer — the assumption being that the designer's intentions are embedded within the designed object which then causes the object's user to do things in certain ways." (Willis 2006:84)

"Once the comfortable fiction of an originary human agent evaporates, the inscriptive power of the designed is revealed and stands naked." (Willis 2006:84)
