Humphry, J., & Chesher, C. (2020). Preparing for smart voice assistants: Cultural histories and media innovations. _New Media & Society_, 1461444820923679. [https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820923679](https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820923679)

## Abstract

Smart voice assistants have become popular thanks largely to their default naturalistic female voices and helpful personae. In this article, we trace changes in robot voices in popular culture and explain how this history influenced the voice design of smart voice assistants. Our research draws on cultural analysis of Hollywood and international films, television and literature, and observations from our personal experiences with voice assistants. We argue that designers of devices like the Google Home and Amazon Echo inherited a cultural imaginary of alien and dangerous robots with artificial voices and personalities. Manufacturers leveraged techniques of modality, personae and invocation and pre-existing social connotations of the voice to create positive associations of these devices in the home. We conclude by arguing that smart voice assistants are new media innovations prepared for consumers through pre-domestication and represent an emerging regime of power and influence based on technologised voice interaction.

"We argue that these histories have informed the emerging discipline of voice user interface (VUI) design applied in the current generation of smart voice assistants on phones and smart speakers." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2))

"At the same time, we analyse the media innovations and strategies of United States-based technology firms that prepare these devices to support their goals of global expansion." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2))

"The use of naturalistic middle-class, female voices and personae positions speakers as friendly participants in everyday family routines. As argued by Woods (2018), this allays fears of surveillance capitalism (Zuboff, 2018) associated with the projects of companies such as Amazon and Google. As we will show, this also works within and against a cultural history of robot voices that play on the social and gendered connotations of voice (Phan, 2017)." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2))

"We begin by examining the emergence of the VUI as a paradigm of human-computer interaction and survey the literature on voice assistants and theories of voice and sound. We examine a number of archetypes of talking robots and computers from Hollywood and international screen culture and explore how these manifestations of the cultural imaginary have informed the design and cultural reception of smart voice assistants. We introduce the concepts of modality, personae and invocation to help explain the selections and exclusions in the voice design of smart voice assistants, and how these shape user interactions in the dominant US smart speaker brands: Amazon, Google and Apple. We apply Van Leeuwen's (1999) concept of modality to show that the voices of smart voice assistants are designed to seem more naturalistically 'human' to avoid the historically negative associations with robotic voices and artificial intelligence. The personae of voice assistants have equally been engineered to adopt norms of gender, race and class to reduce anxieties about their potential to exceed their roles as loyal helpers and cross the boundary into the monstrous. We also analyse the distinctive acts of invocation that characterise these devices as a media form (Chesher, 2001, 2004)." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2))

"We have described this process of managing the meanings of the voice and design of these digital assistants as pre-domestication" ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=2))

"Methodologically, we adopted a cultural history approach (Davis, 2009), documenting and analysing synthetic voices in cinematic and televisual representations, advertising, technical systems and associated documents." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3))

"We draw on theories of voice, speech acts, orality and media (Austin, 1962; Chesher, 2004; Guattari, 1992; Nass and Brave, 2005; Ong, 1982\[1982\]; Searle, 1969; Van Leeuwen, 1999) to conceptualise and interrogate the technocultural construction of voice assistants and VUIs as a new model of humancomputer interaction" ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3))

"A driver in the rise of VUIs is the powerful belief that speech is the most natural form of human communication" ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923681](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=3))

"The social character of voice complicates the apparent naturalness of voice as a medium of human communication. Voice immediately reveals the identity and emotion of the speaker. Voices are gendered. They give away ethnic, regional and subcultural identity as established in cultural studies, sociology and linguistics (Bucholtz and Hall, 2009). They give off emotions such as depression, fear or excitement" ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923682](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=4))

"Critical scholarship on smart speakers has focussed on their technocultural construction, and particularly the cultivation of a female voice and persona as the default. Bergen (2016) points out that it is significant that these voices are disembodied and 'devoid of that leaky, emotive quality that we have come to associate with the feminine body' (101). Strengers and Nicholls (2017) see the voice assistant as a 'wife replacement' (p. 6). Woods (2018) argues that invoking stereotypes of caretaker, mother and wife softens any anxieties from consumers about the surveillant implications and consumerist imperatives of these devices and systems. Hui and Leong (2017) argue that the mobilisation of anthropomorphism, sociability, convenience and humour aims to habituate users to these devices. Phan (2019) argues that Alexa is an aestheticisation and decontextualisation of the domestic servant. In a 'Think piece' in a recent UN report (2019) West et al. (2019) argue that companies recognise that their voice personae are their representatives, and as such need to create a favourable impression. In this context, female voices are preferred, but, this 'has less to do with sound, tone, syntax and cadence, than an association with assistance' (p. 98). The preference for female voices, he argues, also relates to their appeal to the predominantly male (and presumably heterosexual) population in the tech industry developing these devices."

"Pedro's voice is clearly male, while the operator's hands are female and White, and she is instructed by a male engineer." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923683](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=5))

"ne out of control (recalling Frankenstein), and later with the military industrial complex. In our review of mid-20th-century to early 21st-century Hollywood films, we identified a range of dystopian screen narratives that saw the masculine robotic voice become menacing and potentially violent." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923684](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=6))

"As Sofoulis (2001) explains in her analysis of the Star Trek television series, the starship Enterprise functions as a technoworld, an 'agentic and knowing container with various maternal qualities, especially life support' (p. 137). Sofoulis points out that the 'container-mum' (p. 144) manifests in such infrastructural sounds as background hums, high-pitched electronic beeps and electronic sounds emitted from onboard equipment and displays."

"TARS' dialogue modality adjusts accordingly, which illustrates how robots might be designed to be emotionally manipulative." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923686](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=8))

"In all these examples, the voice is a crucial vehicle with which robots and other speaking machines express and perform a persona. The concept of persona, meaning a fictitious character identity, has a long history, coming from the Greek word 'pros≈çpon' which means mask." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923686](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=8))

"VUI developers adopted this concept after recognising its value for getting consumers to identify with their products (Nielsen, 2013). As Dasgupta (2018) argues in a VUI textbook, it helps in 'making the interaction easier and more natural' (p. 43). These developments, drawing on a rich theatrical and literary tradition, have underpinned the shift in the representation of the robot towards more complex and sympathetic characters with distinct personalities." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923686](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=8))

"In these cinematic examples, there has been a trend for robot voices to change from highly artificial and in low modality towards more naturalistic ones. As science fiction narratives explored possible worlds in which machines and humans would become increasingly indistinguishable, voice assistant technologies in the early 21st century were developing higher modality voices and personae with personality." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923687](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=9))

"In 2017, Amazon spent US$22.6 billion and Alphabet spent US$16.2 billion overall on research and development, of which a significant proportion was dedicated to smart voice assistants (Loeb, 2018). T" ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923687](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=9))

"The big tech companies adapted the voices of female voice actors as the default voices for their devices. This choice was strategic, leveraging the social connotations of the feminine voice to produce voice and personae that would appear naturally sympathetic and helpful." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923687](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=9))

"She is helpful without being obsequious, warm without being sexual, intelligent without being arrogant." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923688](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=10))

"The companies assure users that their voice is recorded only after the wake-word is detected. This is not merely a technicality but part of the social design to create intelligible and unthreatening female voices that would also guard against the potential for these devices to expose the home to hackers, corporations or governments." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923688](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=10))

"These controversies highlight the cultural anxieties and tensions that surface when the wake-word proves fallible, and the faithful assistant betrays its promised confidentiality." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923688](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=10))

"An interaction with a smart speaker is usefully seen as a form of invocation." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923688](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=10))

"As these voices are owned by large corporations, these invocational platforms risk reproducing social biases and compromising media pluralism and diversity." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923689](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=11))

"In her study of Google Glass, Saariketo (2018), building on Silverstone and Haddon's (1996, 1998) contributions, suggested that 'pre-domestication' is an important but neglected phase of consumption in which 'people need to be attracted, invited, and interpellated to familiarise \[sic\] with new technology as its potential future users' (p. 1)." ([Humphry and Chesher 2020:1461444820923690](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IK8NKR28?page=12))

"In addition to the physical design of a device and its media representations, which have been the focus of pre-domestication before, we argue that the design of the voice in smart technologies is also a way the meanings of products are articulated. Smart voice assistants are pre-domesticated with their pre-packaged default voices, positioning them in the role of gendered helpers, with voices that are apparently natural, transparent and depoliticised. Through practices in voice design using high modality, a warm and smart persona with the programmed capacity to respond to invocationary acts, consumers' relationships with their smart speakers have been prepared, even before they adopt them, in the form of the non-threatening voice of the female assistant."
