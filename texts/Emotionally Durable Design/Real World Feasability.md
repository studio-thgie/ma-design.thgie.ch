# Real World Feasability

## Chapter summary 

Although the way in which we conduct business today has evolved beyond recognition, the capitalist system that underpins modern corporate affairs has changed very little, persisting that the measure of output from production and manufacturing equates that of societal well-being.

Environmental sensitivity is becoming an increasingly cost-effective practice for future-facing corporations, both in terms of avoiding legislation breach and generating capital via the creation of sustainable brand values.

In allowing consumers to develop a degree of empathy with the products they own, you automatically nurture a visceral empathy with that particular brand.

In terms of sustainability, the efficacy of conventional capitalism must be questioned; more lucrative models exist than the blind nurturing of endless sequences of desire and destruction.

The methods through which we currently address sustainability may not be as sustainable as we think.

Environmentally-aware consumers continue wastefully forth, only now they do so with recycled materials instead of virgin ones. Although it makes a noteworthy stride in the right direction, recycling is not a one-stop solution to sustainable production and consumption.

Sustainability has us nurturing the planet. The Earth does not belong to us, nor does it need nursing like some sick puppy; it just wants to be left well alone.

Sustainable design must delve deeper still to the root of human consciousness, as this is where the solutions lie to what is a human-made environmental crisis.

One of the major factors that has brought about today's commercial interest in environmental issues has been the ensuing barrage of legislation that currently makes its way toward business.

We have a tendency to perceive production as a linear process of resource extraction, manufacture and sales, with little or no consideration given to events that occur afterwards.

Consumers have a more positive image of a company if they see it doing something to make the world a better place. The future survival of many large brands, therefore, will become increasingly dependent upon both the delivery and perceptibility of environmentally conscious practices and products.

Sustainability provides us with the greatest opportunity to radically rethink the way in which we engage with our material worlds; legislation provides the gentle shove that we need to get started.

Enabling consumers to develop empathy with the products they own transforms products into talking points, linking consumers to producers though ongoing dialogues.

The sentiments of leasing might be better expressed through a deeper after-sales relationship between producer and consumer, which essentially enables the absolute ownership of longer-lasting things.

Fostering and maintaining relationships with customers enables businesses to continue generating revenue without the need for further costly manufacturing, resource extraction, energy consumption, atmospheric pollution and waste.

If end users have no desire to keep things for longer, they will not. We need to design products that consumers will actually want to keep, maintain and use for longer periods of time.

## A toolbox of ideas 

Keep up with legislation: maintain currency with legislation so that you can empathize with - and design for - the strict parameters that manufacturers are expected to operate within. Design must endeavour to pioneer new ways to effectively comply with current and forthcoming legislation if it is to serve the needs of a manufacturing industry falling under increasing environmental pressure. Think of environmental legislation as a loose, yet informative, guide to positive change - not the apocalypse to creative freedom itself.

Protract engagement: products serve as agents of sustained engagement between producers and users and can, therefore, be seen as the glue that binds. However, this synergy will only manifest itself when users are effectively motivated to keep their things for long periods of time. Increase the richness and longevity of these relationships by creating objects whose slowly unfolding characteristics command deeper, more empathic, modes of material engagement in order to keep users caught in the hook of consuming them.

Look beyond the symptoms: be mindful of the cosmetic and largely symptom-focused approach that sustainable design ordinarily adopts. Simply specifying recycled materials, for example, does not equate to sustainable production and consumption. Recycling is a great step in the right direction; but it is imperative that we delve deeper than this if more significant developments are to be made to our grossly inefficient production and consumption cycles.

Consider product lifetimes: the designer's role continues throughout an object's entire lifetime, and is about far more than just making things usable, unbreakable and easy on the eye. It is helpful, therefore, to reframe the ongoing interaction between subject and object as a relationship which requires continual growth and evolution if it is to succeed. We as designers must first explore new ways of engendering objects with the capabilities needed to support relationships if this degree of prolonged engagement is, ultimately, to be achieved.
