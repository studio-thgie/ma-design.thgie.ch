        <h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h2>
        <p>Utopias are vital; they free us from the shackles of an
        imperfect present by revealing a limitless world of imaginable
        futures. Yet they also possess a dark side that sets up
        unrealistic expectations, generating false hopes and,
        ultimately, fostering restless cultures of perpetual
        disenchantment with the now.</p>
        <p>By producing streams of objects that signify Utopian values
        based upon a single prescribed and socially approved version of
        reality, material culture becomes inadvertently homogenized into
        one popular version.</p>
        <p>Fiction does not simply exist for the sole purpose of
        entertainment and is more than just a literary genre or category
        of movie per se. Fiction performs a vital role by weaving rich
        narrative threads throughout our daily lives.</p>
        <p>The desire to explore and consume fictions as perceived in
        objects bears strong similarities to the way in which we might
        consume a fictitious movie, play or novel; the emphasis is not
        on authenticity or truth, but on experience and meaning.</p>
        <p>As daily life continues to become more and more programmed,
        the need for fiction, complexity and dialogue in this
        over-streamlined world increases exponentially</p>
        <p>New and, consequently, unfamiliar products radiate
        mysterious, enigmatic qualities that quickly crumble away once
        familiarity begins to accumulate between user and product.</p>
        <p>For an object to continually portray a fictional gestalt, it
        must first possess an ability to conceal, holding a few cards up
        its sleeve in order to avoid total discovery,</p>
        <p>Products possessing overly programmed semantics, or perfect
        products, are particularly vulnerable to the glare of
        de-fictioning; they are too easy to map and pigeonhole.</p>
        <p>Deeper and more intense bonds are forged between users and
        objects when products portray a perceivable sense of
        consciousness. This is not to say that objects should literally
        be conscious; but, rather, a given object may react to its
        surroundings with an ontological receptiveness and flexibility
        of judgement that creates the impression of - or simulates -
        consciousness.</p>
        <p>Tools that begin to explore consciousness simulation, such as
        artificial intelligence and artificial life, are all too
        frequently discussed in terms of their ability to remove the
        decision-making process from humans. .</p>
        <p>We bring our own psychological baggage into the
        meaning-consumption loop; this is why material engagements can
        seem so personal to us.</p>
        <p>We pick up brief reflections of identity through phantile
        drives (PDs) buried deep within products’ layers of
        signification. PDs are like motors that generate meaning once
        perceived; they are phantile in the sense that they are both
        metaphysical and deeply suggestive.</p>
        <p>PDs are frequently deployed to generate eye-opening jolts and
        quirky surprises, like the hello greeting on a HIFI display.
        Gimmicks such as these exemplify one way of working with PDs.
        They deliver an opening jolt of reasonable intensity, yet
        somehow fail to sustain wonderment through the passing of time,
        due once again to the PDs’ inability to grow and evolve over
        time,</p>
        <p>The designing of omnipresent PDs may be facilitated by
        incorporating a measure of openness - or space - within product
        semantics, enhancing the degree of self that may be invested
        into the discursive engagement between subject and object.</p>
        <p>Foreignments may be generated or driven, provided that the
        difference in a given network of meanings is only partially
        modified. Total difference will effectively place the network
        beyond perceivable recognition and, in so doing, will alienate
        the user through an absence of lucid understanding and
        familiarity.</p>
        <p>The ebb and flow of information that surges between subject
        and object is dramatically influenced by users themselves. We
        bring our own catalogue of meanings into any given network, and
        these meanings greatly influence the way in which the said
        network will be perceived. This means that no two people will
        perceive the same jolt – or PD – in the same way.</p>
        <p>PDs deliver surprises and jolts. Omnipresent PDs render the
        said surprises and jolts amorphous, enabling them to evolve
        through time while the user simultaneously evolves and
        grows.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Experience over authenticity: when embedding fictions within
        the semantic layers of an object, try to focus on their
        experiential dimensions rather than what simply constitutes
        conventional reality per se. Thinking beyond - or simply
        ignoring - the accountable will unveil a far greater potential.
        We should not be inhibited by inept notions of accountability
        and truth; instead, let us explore the profound and the numinous
        in search of alternative and more provocative modes of material
        engagement.</p>
        <p>Avoid cheap tricks: PDs are, indeed, potent meaning
        generators, but only when they are deployed in a subtle and
        artful manner. To achieve and sustain this level of sensitivity,
        it may sometimes be necessary for the driven meaning to appear
        accidental, engendering further meaning within the user while
        reducing the gap between subject and object. PDs must not be
        signposted; they should be unwittingly discovered by the
        user</p>
        <p>Keep it moving it is crucial that fictions evolve and grow;
        if they are static – providing one single repetitive jolt - they
        will soon lose their impact and subsequently become de-fictioned
        by the user. To remain potent, therefore, fiction must
        continually enchant users by shifting and evolving at all times.
        Transience of this kind may be achieved through deliberately
        deceiving or misdirecting users, creating multiple false
        information flows that may be switched at any time.</p>
        <p>Avoid over-programming. it is vital that a degree of
        ambiguity and space is embedded within a given product semantic.
        This means that although sufficient intuitive information may be
        made evident for the user to operate the product, undefined
        interactive space should also be made available to be explored
        and defined by the subject as the relationship unfolds. This
        undefined space also provides a kind of mirror, which reflects
        back the individual idiosyncrasies of each user, rendering each
        interaction unique and personal.</p>
