# Attachments with Objects
## Chapter summary 
Archaeologists have made numerous findings that suggest the prehistoric origins of material culture. Although the ways in which we manipulate matter today may have developed beyond recognition, our existential and frequently animistic utilization of material artefacts remains unchanged.

Many blame the mid 1900s industrial revolution for today's overabundant production, consumption and subsequent environmental decay, stating that such enhanced production capabilities were beyond our control and was like giving a Ferrari to a four-year old.

In this oversaturated world of people and things, durable attachments with objects are seldom witnessed; most products deliver a predictable diatribe of information, which quickly transforms wonder into drudgery.

Disappointment may be characterized by a real-time imbalance between expectation and reality.

The passionate early stages of a subject-object relationship could be described as a honeymoon period. Most emotional attachments are withdrawn once the honeymoon period draws to a close, largely because the evolution that takes place is grossly polarized, occurring exclusively within users.

Products make claims that are hard to back up, promising the world to consumers from the safety of the shop window. Although short-term edge may be acquired via this strategy, raising expectations increases the likelihood of disappointment.

The emotional instability of humans provides a wild card element to the development of attachments with objects; the development of empathic relationships with objects is powerfully influenced by this characteristic instability

Dependency and neediness often bridge the void between otherwise separate entities, creating relationships founded on the symbiotic exchange of reliance and need. If the simulation is not genuine it will be cast off by the user as gadgetry.

Everyday objects that engage the senses invade our lives and literally depend upon our care and attention in order to survive. Designers must aim to increase the intensity and perceptibility of subject-object dependency, enabling products to achieve deeper and more immersive modes of prolonged user engagement.

Alterity is experienced by users as the feeling that something is both autonomous and is in possession of its own free will; when objects embody this eccentric quality, the relationships forged between subject and object are frequently strong and long lasting.

As an object's level of autonomy increases, the apparent level of dependency decreases exponentially. Although this may enhance an object's eccentricity, it is questionable as to whether or not it is beneficial to a relationship's longevity.

Cherishability is a powerful signifier of an object's capacity to be cherished, loved and cared for by whatever means; in this way it is a valuable term for measuring the degree of dependency perceived in a given object.

Emotionally rich interactions may be engendered through the incorporation of feed-forward and inherent feedback. Inherent feedback must reflect the subtle ambiguities of feed-forward, enabling the black and white world of traditional interaction to develop a shade of grey, situated somewhere in the fuzzy space between on and off, yes and no.

When subject-object interactions develop greater degrees of intuition, the boundaries between flesh and polymer disintegrate to make way for new and provocative modes of material engagement

Fuzzy interfaces present users with complex, artful scenarios that must be learned and mastered - a novel departure from the unconsciously simple, spoon-fed manner in which interface design has become accustomed, toward a craft-like engagement in which the skill and mastery of an object must be acquired slowly, over time.

Many interaction designers are beginning to suspect that as pace increases, experience decreases; this is sometimes referred to as diminishing returns.

The experience provided by a roller coaster is pace-oriented; however, without the lengthy queuing period and the slow ascent up to the ride's highest point, the experience would surely be less rich.

Alternative modes of interaction serve to remind us that modern streamlining endeavours may have inadvertently stripped the world of all its charm.

## A toolbox of ideas 

Keep it real: always ensure that objects deliver what they promise. Authenticity plays a crucial role in the nurturing of sustainable subject and object attachments; its absence drives a colossal wedge between subject and object, and what empathy may have been developed prior to this realization promptly disintegrates.

Design for dependency: think beyond the conventional master and slave hegemony underpinning contemporary material relations, toward a more synergistic 'consumerscape' in which human and object coexist on a range of physical and emotional levels. In order for this immersive level of engagement to be achieved, the division of responsibility, effort and reward must be shared between subject and object.

A mind of its own: give objects the appearance of having a mind of their own, or at least aim to simulate the subtle and random presence of free will. This simulation can be created by engendering a degree of disobedience into products, rendering them less yes and no, and more maybe. A light touch is required here, as excess alterity transforms previously subordinate products into adolescent rogues, which in many cases hit landfill several days later.

Inherent feedback: try to initiate interactions of a greater emotional richness and durability by ensuring that feedback is inherent. This is achieved by embodying a distinct relatedness within feedback, with the unique idiosyncrasies of feed-forward, creating several shades of grey between the black and white world of on and off.
