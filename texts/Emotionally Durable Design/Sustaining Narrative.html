        <p>Beneath the silken skin of mass manufacturing, harsh
        contradictions dwell regarding the explicit nature of the
        newness that consumers actually desire.</p>
        <p>Objects capable of delivering durable narrative experiences
        already pollute the mainstream, though most remain cautiously
        quarantined within lowtech product genres.</p>
        <p>Consciousness is interpreted by consumers as the feeling that
        something has autonomy: a set of intentions based purely around
        one’s particular existence, or something that seems to be in
        possession of its own free will or alterity.</p>
        <p>Objects that evolve slowly over time build up layers of
        narrative by reflecting traces of the user’s invested care.</p>
        <p>JNDs define the amount that something must be altered in
        order for the difference to be perceivable.</p>
        <p>When consumers develop empathy with products, a visceral
        empathy is nurtured with the brand; customers are subsequently
        kept loyal and market share is healthily sustained.</p>
        <p>Narrative experiences must not be over-programmed;
        spontaneous occurrences create the magic between subject and
        object. Without them, relationships seldom supersede the banal.
        Spontaneity and magic should be catalysed rather than planned
        through an object’s ability to echo the idiosyncrasies of each
        individual user.</p>
        <p>Most consumer products are like stories with an incredible
        opening line, but which just continue repeating it throughout.
        Their storytelling capabilities are pathetically limited.</p>
        <p>Transient consumption is not unlike the consumption of
        stories, movies and gossip; it, too, is goal orientated, with a
        strong emphasis on uncovering mystery and knowing all there is
        to know.</p>
        <p>Durable narratives must side step the deflowering gaze of the
        consumer, maintaining enchantment while never actually being
        fully understood. Captivating narratives must play on our
        deepest desires, dreams and fears in order to hold us in their
        grasp: enchanted and helpless.</p>
        <p>The pace at which narratives unfold is as crucial as the
        narrative itself; too slow, and it will generate frustration,
        too fast and it will alienate the consumer through utter
        confusion.</p>
        <p>Durable narrative experiences must embody multiple layers,
        enabling a number of co-dependent narratives to be experienced
        simultaneously – revealing, on discovery, not answers or grand
        finales but deeper and more complex layers.</p>
        <p>A frame tale is a sustainable narrative technique in which
        the main story is constructed in order to organize a collection
        of shorter stories, concocting rich narrative textures loaded
        with tension and complexity.</p>
        <p>A smooth shift must occur; if a storyteller were to
        continually switch stories every few lines, we would surely
        become lost and, consequently, experience alienation. If the
        story is incrementally developed and grown, we engage
        passionately with it.</p>
        <p>Users must be designed into object narratives as co-producers
        and not simply as inert, passive witnesses, a process that
        enables the nature of user interaction to shape the emergent
        narrative.</p>
        <p>Patina writes narrative into both the semiotic make-up and
        aggregate semantic of material experiences, holding great
        influence over the particular nature of the experiences that
        users are likely to perceive. However, the values affixed to the
        ageing of material surfaces are loaded with contradiction and
        are, at present, deeply genre specific.</p>
        <p>It is imperative that patina is seen as a co-dependent
        element of the whole, rather than a one-stop approach to durable
        product design. Patina is, indeed, a potent addition to the
        designer’s toolbox, but one that must be deployed with subtlety
        and caution.</p>
        <p>In any physical product scenario, the ageing process will
        occur as it always does. It is therefore crucial that products
        are designed to both accommodate and embrace their inevitable
        future. This way the onset of ageing will concentrate rather
        than dilute the gestalt, while reframing signs of age and
        overall product maturity as desirable consumer destinies.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Layers of narrative: durable narrative experiences must
        embody multiple layers, allowing numerous interwoven narratives
        to be simultaneously cognized and revealing, on discovery, not
        answers or grand finales, but deeper and more complex layers
        lurking even deeper within the object’s semiotic make-up. Frame
        tales are helpful here, whereby a main story is constructed in
        order to organize a collection of shorter sub-stories, enabling
        the artful concoction of rich narratives loaded with tension and
        complexity.</p>
        <p>Producers not observers: when embedding narrative experiences
        within products, always perceive the user more as a co-producer
        of the narrative, rather than just a passive observer. This way,
        the narrative experience that does eventually unfold will be a
        unique experience since it has – to some degree - been shaped
        and produced by each unique and individual user.</p>
        <p>Pace: pay careful attention to the pace at which narrative
        experiences unfold; too slow and they will generate frustration,
        too fast and they will alienate the consumer through utter
        confusion. Ideally, pace should be varied, ensuring that an air
        of uncertainty circulates the object, while also optimizing the
        sense of anticipation to nurture an intense connectedness
        between subject and object.</p>
        <p>Ageing gracefully: anticipate the ageing process of objects.
        Whether we like it or not, things get old, and it is imperative
        that we begin designing for desirable ageing as a means to
        embrace their inevitable futures. This is not to say that
        everything should be made using wood, denim or perhaps, leather;
        rather, provocative design concepts must emerge that challenge
        our social desire for a scratch-free world, illustrating how the
        onset of ageing could actually concentrate rather than dilute
        the gestalt.</p>
