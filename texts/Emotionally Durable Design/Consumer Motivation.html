        <p>## Chapter summary Material consumption is driven by complex
        motivations and is about far more than just the acquisition of
        newer, shinier things. It is an endless personal journey toward
        the ideal or desired self that, by its very nature, becomes a
        process of incremental destruction.</p>
        <p>Ecological procrastination could be likened to the experience
        of delaying a visit to the dentist. Though perfectly aware that
        each day brings further discomfort, the decaying tooth goes
        unattended, ensuring that the inevitable operation will be far
        more dreadful when it does eventually arrive.</p>
        <p>We are consumers of meaning and not matter; products provide
        a chassis that signify the meanings to be consumed. We transfer
        resources into products that - in a sense - provide us with
        existential mirrors, allowing us to view and experience our
        dreams and desires in real time.</p>
        <p>Material consumption operates on a range of experiential
        layers; consumers mine these layers, unearthing meaningful
        content as they steadily excavate deeper into the semiotic core
        of an object. Designers must weave intricacy amongst the layers
        of an object in order to optimize the sustainability of this
        meaningfulness.</p>
        <p>New needs emerge the moment old needs are met, thus nurturing
        the infinite sequence of desire and destruction that is so
        characteristic of the modern world</p>
        <p>The notion of meaning is highly context specific: the meaning
        of a rat in a pet shop differs greatly from that of the same rat
        in a restaurant kitchen. Meaning can thus be loosely directed by
        designers, but never fully controlled</p>
        <p>Doggedly pursuing the dream of a technologically enhanced and
        physically durable world has enabled us to fabricate a plateau
        of material immunity. Durable metals, polymers and composite
        materials have enabled us to construct this synthetic
        “futurescape’; immune to the glare of biological decay, these
        materials grossly outlive our desire for them and so the
        illusion of control bares its first predicament: waste.</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom dictates that goods are nullified by
        substantial shifts in technology, format or other operational
        protocol; however, obsolescence is also a consumer side issue
        driven by the failure of products to quench the human thirst for
        new, fresh experiences.</p>
        <p>The uptake of products is partially motivated by the notion
        of deflowering; we consume the unknown in order to demystify and
        familiarize. Modern products lack character; they are too smart
        and precise, removing all possible surprise, mystery and,
        perhaps above all, charm from the process of engagement.</p>
        <p>The ego exists as an accumulation of aspirations and dreams,
        maintaining false appearances and portraying an aggregate
        self-image of coherence, completeness and success.</p>
        <p>As a materialist society, we commonly represent and
        communicate the fabric of our egos through objects as opposed to
        language.</p>
        <p>Most products are capable of creating even a small amount of
        empathy at the point of purchase; from this point on, however,
        product lifespans depend upon the sustainability of that
        empathy. Waste, therefore, could be seen as a symptom of expired
        empathy: a failed relationship that led to the dumping of one by
        the other.</p>
        <p>In human pair bonding, when empathy fades the original bond
        weakens. Another fresh bonding urge is motivated, resulting in
        the acquisition of another; the original relationship is
        rendered obsolete.</p>
        <p>Various notions of product life orbit the creative sphere and
        have done so for some time. In the majority of cases, objects
        are supposedly rendered durable via the specification of
        resilient materials, repairable technologies and robust design
        engineering. Landfills bloat with strata upon strata of durable
        goods, slowly living out their tough robust existences beneath
        10,000 tonnes of likeminded scrap.</p>
        <p>There is little point designing physical durability into
        consumer goods if consumers have no desire to keep them.</p>
        <p>In attending solely to physical ageing, designers overlook
        numerous metaphysical renderings of durability. As a creative
        industry it is vital that we break away from the physical and
        begin to understand more about the sustainability of empathy,
        meaning, desire and other metaphysical factors that influence
        the duration of product life.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>See beyond the physical: it is important to see beyond the
        physical, attending equally to the meanings that a product
        signifies. Essentially, consumers acquire meanings, not objects;
        objects simply provide a way of perceiving the meaning.
        Furthermore, try to gauge through scenario-building to what
        degree these meanings are sustainable and how they might evolve
        over time, if at all.</p>
        <p>Relinquish control: avoid over-programming the product
        semantic to ensure that sufficient space is left for the
        inclusion of the user’s psyche. The ambiguous qualities that
        manifest as a result of designing in this way increase the
        likelihood of chance discoveries, randomness and intimacy,
        which, in turn, greatly facilitate the nurture of subject-object
        empathy.</p>
        <p>Keep the magic alive: make sure that a few cards are
        concealed up the object’s sleeve; if a product relinquishes all
        meaning in a single fleeting glance - experientially – consumers
        have nowhere left to go. By designing products to patiently
        deliver a series of future discoveries and revelatory
        happenings, the life of an object is dramatically increased as
        users remain captivated in anticipation of the next event.</p>
        <p>Meaning is context specific utilize the instability of
        meaning as an agent of chance. Object meanings change
        significantly in relation to their contextual surroundings;
        designers must embrace this unpredictable quality as it enables
        objects to radiate multiple personalities, which scupper the
        user’s attempts to out-know them.</p>
