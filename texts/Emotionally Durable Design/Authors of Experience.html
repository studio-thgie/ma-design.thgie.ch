        <p>To measure experiences in terms of their intensity or power
        is counterproductive. It is the subtle and more ephemeral user
        experiences that penetrate the psyche through the slow passage
        of time.</p>
        <p>Most user experiences are never consciously realized; they
        are perceived only within deeper levels of processing.</p>
        <p>Seldom do we witness users affectionately stroking and
        caressing machines after they perform well; it often is not
        until something misbehaves that it actually gets noticed.</p>
        <p>Whether planned that way or not, users will have some degree
        of experience from interacting with practically any object. The
        crucial thing is to both sustain and evolve that experience so
        that it is revisited and frequently re-evaluated by the
        captivated user.</p>
        <p>If an object excessively arouses the user, their ability to
        interact coherently with it deteriorates quickly.</p>
        <p>A little misbehaviour here and there is a healthy thing;
        acting directly against the user’s will engenders a high degree
        of autonomy.</p>
        <p>Emotionally demanding objects that do nothing but provoke and
        antagonize their users may not live long. They are too high
        maintenance and, thus, a permanent source of irritation.</p>
        <p>The Swiss Army Knife approach to design crams in functions
        often at the expense of usability in an attempt to engender
        meaning.</p>
        <p>Qualitative user experiences are not engendered by
        incrementally escalating the utilitarian capabilities of a given
        object or by simply by bolting on extra functionality.</p>
        <p>The work of experience designers has tended to centre itself
        within the digital sphere; however, the discipline’s potential
        stretches far beyond the design of online media.</p>
        <p>User experience has always been a design consideration; yet
        it is a consideration rarely applied to mundane everyday genres
        of objects,</p>
        <p>In today’s restless world of unceasing technological
        miniaturization, the need for objects capable of purveying
        potent experiential and emotional resonance is greater than
        ever.</p>
        <p>The role of emotion established itself as a branch of design
        discourse within the latter part of the 20th century, adopting
        an ever more prevalent position within contemporary design
        debate today.</p>
        <p>It may not be possible to establish a semantic connection
        between emotions and the very notion of experience or, perhaps,
        to pin human emotions down within a succinctly unified
        theory.</p>
        <p>It is already tacit to most creative practitioners that
        emotions play a key role in engendering resonant user
        experiences; this awareness in itself may actually be
        enough.</p>
        <p>That we have a name for each emotion does not mean we
        understand them. We have names for the universe and the ancient
        Chinese system the I-Ching yet both are far from understood.</p>
        <p>Emotional responses provide the foundations of individuality:
        they are what distinguish us from others. Products provide
        triggers for this vital sociological process to occur.</p>
        <p>Although designers can elicit emotional responses, the
        explicit nature of the response is beyond control. The unique
        assemblage of past experiences particular to each user
        determines this.</p>
        <p>Designers need only provoke an emotional response - whatever
        that may be - as users will ultimately project their personality
        onto the object just as long as it continues to stimulate that
        vital response.</p>
        <p>Immersive experiences are all encompassing, provoking
        meaningful associations that frequently catalyse robust
        emotional connections between subject and object.</p>
        <p>In failing to evolve, the intensity and meaning of a given
        stimulus crumbles away simply through familiarity and
        repetition.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Strike a balance: emotionally demanding objects that do
        nothing but provoke and antagonize their users may not live
        long; they are too high maintenance and, thus, a permanent
        source of irritation. Always aim to establish equilibrium
        between optimal degrees of emotional arousal, with a consistent
        measure of usability and performance. This will facilitate the
        smooth delivery of rich and emotionally charged experiences
        without compromising the behavioural fluidity of elementary
        subject-object interaction.</p>
        <p>Provoke a response: design objects that provoke some kind of
        emotional response from the user. The way in which we each
        respond emotionally to given stimuli is what both separates and
        defines us as unique individuals; therefore, creating objects
        and experiences that provoke a distinct and clear emotional
        response - whatever the response may be – will engender the felt
        sense of individuality, self-definition and the affirmation of
        identity within users.</p>
        <p>Designers also consume: when attempting to design for and
        anticipate an emotional response, start by evaluating your own
        responses to things and consider how you might perceive a given
        experience. As designers we are fortunate to have experience as
        both creators and end users; it is crucial that this simple fact
        is never forgotten as intuitive insight frequently provides the
        most potent creative tool.</p>
        <p>Create meaning: a meaningful association must first be
        perceived within an object before users may experience any
        arousal and subsequent emotion. Easily cognizable meanings
        provide the essential foundation upon which arousal and emotion
        are constructed. Therefore, it is helpful to consider how an
        object will be perceived by the user and what meanings may be
        associated with that initial perception.</p>
