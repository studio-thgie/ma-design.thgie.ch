        <h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h2>
        <p>Environmental concern is nothing new; recorded awareness of
        human impact on the biosphere dates as far back as the 13th
        century.</p>
        <p>Connections between emergent cultures of superfluous
        materialism and environmental decay were acknowledged in late
        19th-century Britain at the dawn of the decadent Arts and Crafts
        period.</p>
        <p>Population growth alone is not a problem for planet Earth;
        the growth of a species whose presence has negative impacts on
        all other life must be seen as a potential ecological
        crisis.</p>
        <p>The rampant consumption and waste of natural resources so
        prevalent in the developed world is a legacy of modern times,
        born largely from the inappropriate marriage of excessive
        material durability with fleeting product-use careers.</p>
        <p>In their current guise, sustainable design methodologies lack
        philosophical depth, adopting a symptom-focused approach
        comparable to that of Western medicine.</p>
        <p>Despite the efforts of sustainable design, today’s consumers
        continue wastefully on, but now with recycled materials instead
        of virgin ones.</p>
        <p>Many researchers are beginning to suspect that recycling
        actually provides an ethical ‘get out of jail free’ card,
        liberating consumer conscience and generating even more
        waste.</p>
        <p>The future survival of many large brands will become
        increasingly dependent upon both the delivery and perceptibility
        of eco-conscious practices and products.</p>
        <p>Mainstream industrial design has become technocentric,
        incorporating contemporary technologies within archaic product
        typologies.</p>
        <p>During recent years, technological innovation has taken
        centre stage at the expense of other less tangible, though
        equally potent, creative considerations</p>
        <p>Material possessions are deployed as signifiers of status,
        casting us within socially desirable roles, stimulating edgy
        cultures of habitual comparing.</p>
        <p>Both the range and intensity of emotional experiences
        delivered by products born of a technocentric mindset are
        incredibly limited and offer very little to users.</p>
        <p>Placing technological contemporaneousness as the sole product
        valueindicator ensures loss of meaning the moment a newer model
        hits the shelves.</p>
        <p>Technocentric design will fade as consumers tire of chasing
        unattainable utopias, giving way to new specialist genres of
        design and consumption fuelled by more profound and poetic user
        experiences that penetrate the psyche over time.</p>
        <p>The 20th century witnessed a steady societal migration away
        from deep communal values toward a fast-food culture of nomadic
        individualism and excessive materialism; today, empathy is
        consumed not so much from each other, but through fleeting
        embraces with objects.</p>
        <p>Developed world consumer desires relentlessly grow and flex,
        while material possessions remain hopelessly frozen in time. The
        mountain of waste this single inconsistency generates is
        apocalyptic, coming at increasing cost to legislation-swamped
        manufacturers and the natural world.</p>
        <p>Landfills around the word swell with fully functional
        appliances - freezers that still freeze and toasters that still
        toast - their only crime being a failure to sustain empathy with
        their users.</p>
        <p>Emotionally Durable Design will transport users beyond the
        ephemeral world of technocentric design toward a rich,
        interactive domain of emotionally durable objects and
        experiences.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Environment as user: when attempting to engage with
        sustainability, think of the environment as just another end
        user – a user with specific needs, demands and limitations. It
        follows that good design, therefore, will aim to accommodate the
        requirements of all potential users: corporate, consumer and
        environment.</p>
        <p>Material life: when planning product lifespan, consider the
        lifespan of the materials from which the product is made. For
        example, renewable materials from the biosphere, including
        compostable plant-based composites and biopolymers, all offer
        designers a short-lived and lowimpact alternative to the
        recyclable, but all too durable, plastics, elastomers and resins
        that are so widely used today; immune to the glare of biological
        decay, these materials grossly outlive our desire for them.</p>
        <p>Causes not symptoms: adopt the philosophy of ancient Chinese
        medicine; focus on the causes of our environmental destruction,
        not just on how to clean up or minimize the obvious
        after-effects. Rather than solely addressing waste, target and
        design for the motivations underpinning it; this is where the
        fundamental changes lurk.</p>
        <p>Poetic potential: think beyond technological modernity by
        exploring the potential for other, more poetic, experiential and
        interactive forms of product evolution and innovation -
        embedding less transient, enduring values within products that
        may be sustained through the slow passing of time.</p>
