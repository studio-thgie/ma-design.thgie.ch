        <h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h2>
        <p>Archaeologists have made numerous findings that suggest the
        prehistoric origins of material culture. Although the ways in
        which we manipulate matter today may have developed beyond
        recognition, our existential and frequently animistic
        utilization of material artefacts remains unchanged.</p>
        <p>Many blame the mid 1900s industrial revolution for today’s
        overabundant production, consumption and subsequent
        environmental decay, stating that such enhanced production
        capabilities were beyond our control and was like giving a
        Ferrari to a four-year old.</p>
        <p>In this oversaturated world of people and things, durable
        attachments with objects are seldom witnessed; most products
        deliver a predictable diatribe of information, which quickly
        transforms wonder into drudgery.</p>
        <p>Disappointment may be characterized by a real-time imbalance
        between expectation and reality.</p>
        <p>The passionate early stages of a subject-object relationship
        could be described as a honeymoon period. Most emotional
        attachments are withdrawn once the honeymoon period draws to a
        close, largely because the evolution that takes place is grossly
        polarized, occurring exclusively within users.</p>
        <p>Products make claims that are hard to back up, promising the
        world to consumers from the safety of the shop window. Although
        short-term edge may be acquired via this strategy, raising
        expectations increases the likelihood of disappointment.</p>
        <p>The emotional instability of humans provides a wild card
        element to the development of attachments with objects; the
        development of empathic relationships with objects is powerfully
        influenced by this characteristic instability</p>
        <p>Dependency and neediness often bridge the void between
        otherwise separate entities, creating relationships founded on
        the symbiotic exchange of reliance and need. If the simulation
        is not genuine it will be cast off by the user as gadgetry.</p>
        <p>Everyday objects that engage the senses invade our lives and
        literally depend upon our care and attention in order to
        survive. Designers must aim to increase the intensity and
        perceptibility of subject-object dependency, enabling products
        to achieve deeper and more immersive modes of prolonged user
        engagement.</p>
        <p>Alterity is experienced by users as the feeling that
        something is both autonomous and is in possession of its own
        free will; when objects embody this eccentric quality, the
        relationships forged between subject and object are frequently
        strong and long lasting.</p>
        <p>As an object’s level of autonomy increases, the apparent
        level of dependency decreases exponentially. Although this may
        enhance an object’s eccentricity, it is questionable as to
        whether or not it is beneficial to a relationship’s
        longevity.</p>
        <p>Cherishability is a powerful signifier of an object’s
        capacity to be cherished, loved and cared for by whatever means;
        in this way it is a valuable term for measuring the degree of
        dependency perceived in a given object.</p>
        <p>Emotionally rich interactions may be engendered through the
        incorporation of feed-forward and inherent feedback. Inherent
        feedback must reflect the subtle ambiguities of feed-forward,
        enabling the black and white world of traditional interaction to
        develop a shade of grey, situated somewhere in the fuzzy space
        between on and off, yes and no.</p>
        <p>When subject-object interactions develop greater degrees of
        intuition, the boundaries between flesh and polymer disintegrate
        to make way for new and provocative modes of material
        engagement</p>
        <p>Fuzzy interfaces present users with complex, artful scenarios
        that must be learned and mastered - a novel departure from the
        unconsciously simple, spoon-fed manner in which interface design
        has become accustomed, toward a craft-like engagement in which
        the skill and mastery of an object must be acquired slowly, over
        time.</p>
        <p>Many interaction designers are beginning to suspect that as
        pace increases, experience decreases; this is sometimes referred
        to as diminishing returns.</p>
        <p>The experience provided by a roller coaster is pace-oriented;
        however, without the lengthy queuing period and the slow ascent
        up to the ride’s highest point, the experience would surely be
        less rich.</p>
        <p>Alternative modes of interaction serve to remind us that
        modern streamlining endeavours may have inadvertently stripped
        the world of all its charm.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Keep it real: always ensure that objects deliver what they
        promise. Authenticity plays a crucial role in the nurturing of
        sustainable subject and object attachments; its absence drives a
        colossal wedge between subject and object, and what empathy may
        have been developed prior to this realization promptly
        disintegrates.</p>
        <p>Design for dependency: think beyond the conventional master
        and slave hegemony underpinning contemporary material relations,
        toward a more synergistic ‘consumerscape’ in which human and
        object coexist on a range of physical and emotional levels. In
        order for this immersive level of engagement to be achieved, the
        division of responsibility, effort and reward must be shared
        between subject and object.</p>
        <p>A mind of its own: give objects the appearance of having a
        mind of their own, or at least aim to simulate the subtle and
        random presence of free will. This simulation can be created by
        engendering a degree of disobedience into products, rendering
        them less yes and no, and more maybe. A light touch is required
        here, as excess alterity transforms previously subordinate
        products into adolescent rogues, which in many cases hit
        landfill several days later.</p>
        <p>Inherent feedback: try to initiate interactions of a greater
        emotional richness and durability by ensuring that feedback is
        inherent. This is achieved by embodying a distinct relatedness
        within feedback, with the unique idiosyncrasies of feed-forward,
        creating several shades of grey between the black and white
        world of on and off.</p>
