        <p>Although the way in which we conduct business today has
        evolved beyond recognition, the capitalist system that underpins
        modern corporate affairs has changed very little, persisting
        that the measure of output from production and manufacturing
        equates that of societal well-being.</p>
        <p>Environmental sensitivity is becoming an increasingly
        cost-effective practice for future-facing corporations, both in
        terms of avoiding legislation breach and generating capital via
        the creation of sustainable brand values.</p>
        <p>In allowing consumers to develop a degree of empathy with the
        products they own, you automatically nurture a visceral empathy
        with that particular brand.</p>
        <p>In terms of sustainability, the efficacy of conventional
        capitalism must be questioned; more lucrative models exist than
        the blind nurturing of endless sequences of desire and
        destruction.</p>
        <p>The methods through which we currently address sustainability
        may not be as sustainable as we think.</p>
        <p>Environmentally-aware consumers continue wastefully forth,
        only now they do so with recycled materials instead of virgin
        ones. Although it makes a noteworthy stride in the right
        direction, recycling is not a one-stop solution to sustainable
        production and consumption.</p>
        <p>Sustainability has us nurturing the planet. The Earth does
        not belong to us, nor does it need nursing like some sick puppy;
        it just wants to be left well alone.</p>
        <p>Sustainable design must delve deeper still to the root of
        human consciousness, as this is where the solutions lie to what
        is a human-made environmental crisis.</p>
        <p>One of the major factors that has brought about today’s
        commercial interest in environmental issues has been the ensuing
        barrage of legislation that currently makes its way toward
        business.</p>
        <p>We have a tendency to perceive production as a linear process
        of resource extraction, manufacture and sales, with little or no
        consideration given to events that occur afterwards.</p>
        <p>Consumers have a more positive image of a company if they see
        it doing something to make the world a better place. The future
        survival of many large brands, therefore, will become
        increasingly dependent upon both the delivery and perceptibility
        of environmentally conscious practices and products.</p>
        <p>Sustainability provides us with the greatest opportunity to
        radically rethink the way in which we engage with our material
        worlds; legislation provides the gentle shove that we need to
        get started.</p>
        <p>Enabling consumers to develop empathy with the products they
        own transforms products into talking points, linking consumers
        to producers though ongoing dialogues.</p>
        <p>The sentiments of leasing might be better expressed through a
        deeper after-sales relationship between producer and consumer,
        which essentially enables the absolute ownership of
        longer-lasting things.</p>
        <p>Fostering and maintaining relationships with customers
        enables businesses to continue generating revenue without the
        need for further costly manufacturing, resource extraction,
        energy consumption, atmospheric pollution and waste.</p>
        <p>If end users have no desire to keep things for longer, they
        will not. We need to design products that consumers will
        actually want to keep, maintain and use for longer periods of
        time.</p>
        <h2 id="a-toolbox-of-ideas">A toolbox of ideas</h2>
        <p>Keep up with legislation: maintain currency with legislation
        so that you can empathize with - and design for - the strict
        parameters that manufacturers are expected to operate within.
        Design must endeavour to pioneer new ways to effectively comply
        with current and forthcoming legislation if it is to serve the
        needs of a manufacturing industry falling under increasing
        environmental pressure. Think of environmental legislation as a
        loose, yet informative, guide to positive change - not the
        apocalypse to creative freedom itself.</p>
        <p>Protract engagement: products serve as agents of sustained
        engagement between producers and users and can, therefore, be
        seen as the glue that binds. However, this synergy will only
        manifest itself when users are effectively motivated to keep
        their things for long periods of time. Increase the richness and
        longevity of these relationships by creating objects whose
        slowly unfolding characteristics command deeper, more empathic,
        modes of material engagement in order to keep users caught in
        the hook of consuming them.</p>
        <p>Look beyond the symptoms: be mindful of the cosmetic and
        largely symptom-focused approach that sustainable design
        ordinarily adopts. Simply specifying recycled materials, for
        example, does not equate to sustainable production and
        consumption. Recycling is a great step in the right direction;
        but it is imperative that we delve deeper than this if more
        significant developments are to be made to our grossly
        inefficient production and consumption cycles.</p>
        <p>Consider product lifetimes: the designer’s role continues
        throughout an object’s entire lifetime, and is about far more
        than just making things usable, unbreakable and easy on the eye.
        It is helpful, therefore, to reframe the ongoing interaction
        between subject and object as a relationship which requires
        continual growth and evolution if it is to succeed. We as
        designers must first explore new ways of engendering objects
        with the capabilities needed to support relationships if this
        degree of prolonged engagement is, ultimately, to be
        achieved.</p>
