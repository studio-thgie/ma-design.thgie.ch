        view</li>
        <li>Reactive / Active - Practices</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>

        <ul>
        <li>3 phases, collecting, analysis and prototyping</li>
        <li>Looked at Problem through Industrial Design
        <ul>

        <li>Focus on voice assistants
        <ul>

        to a thing lends itself</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Weak Signals, to be extrapolated into testable prototype
        <ul>
        <li>what are these in general and in the context of this
        project</li>
        <li>why was that important
        <ul>
        <li>animist practices still present, ie Piguet research on
        animism in children</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Research Body / Data
        <ul>
        <li>~25h of direct observation in the homes of owners of
        VAs</li>
        <li>several interviews with longtime owners of VAs</li>
        <li>user journeys of unboxing and setup of new owners of
        VAs</li>
        <li>also collected online voices, as well as images of
        advertisements as well as hacked or customized voice
        assistants</li>
        <li>Workshop
        <ul>
        <li>capture the voices of designers and their respective
        disciplines</li>
        <li>working with research body, pre-findings / pre-themes</li>
        <li>taking methods from speculative/future design</li>
        <li>produce stories that imagine alternative near future
        scenarios of how we live with VAs</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Thematic Analysis
        <ul>
        <li>process of TA (data -&gt; labeling -&gt; Themes)</li>
        <li>comparable to affinity mapping, but more of a deep
        reading</li>
        <li>reflexive approach after Brown and Clarke
        <ul>
        <li>intuitively and according with my own values as research as
        an embodied practice -&gt; quote “creating, not emerging”</li>
        <li>trail of truth</li>
        <li>reflexive in the work -&gt; journal, describing</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>220 codes, 6 subthemes and 1 final theme</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Findings
        <ul>
        <li>Slightly disappointed at findings but were to be
        expected</li>
        <li>was set out to discover and work with weak signals of active
        practices coming from an epistemological source -&gt; top
        right</li>
        <li>found reactive practices coming from a phenomenological
        basis -&gt; bottom left
        <ul>
        <li>place VAs on Matrix (phe/re)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>two themes; trust issues, uncanny valley</li>
        <li>Found ample examples of the uncanny valley
        <ul>
        <li>VAs treated as non-human actants but often creepy
        <ul>
        <li>device activation, unnatural communication, sheer
        presence</li>
        <li>Participants miss a proper vocabulary to deal with the
        non-human presence in case of errors and generally have a hard
        time bonding with VAs</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Trust Issues
        <ul>

        <li>Macro -&gt; Micro
        <ul>
        <li>Macro; Privacy -&gt; closed sourced technologies and data
        tracking practices</li>
        <li>Midi; Intimacy -&gt; VAs as invisible interfaces entziehen
        sich in a negotiation of intimacy, while still embeding
        themselves in the social strata of the home</li>
        <li>Micro; Consent -&gt; No control in exchange, the user is
        unable to disagree</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Alexa Alien anecdote</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Implication
        <ul>
        <li>from animism in the focus to animism as a given
        <ul>
        <li>usage of animism is more reflected now with the help of the
        matrix</li>
        <li>was able to focus research question</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>prototyping user journeys
        <ul>
        <li>how can we negotiate trust, respectively privacy, intimacy
        and consent with iot devices like voice assistants</li>
        <li>shift from materialities and product design to interaction
        and user experience design</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Optional - betti marenkos neo-animism in design framework -
        uncertainity (ambiguity) to encourage exploration of system as
        well as relateability - Ambiguity - jonathan chapmans
        emotionally durable design<br />
