        comparative exploration of voice assistants as assistive
        technologies for blind people</h2>
        <p>This research project is about exploring the potential of
        voice assistant technologies for the blind as well people with
        visual impairments, the extent to which this technologies can
        provide and assist access to the world, and how their design
        could be improved to serve the specific needs of the target
        demographic.</p>
