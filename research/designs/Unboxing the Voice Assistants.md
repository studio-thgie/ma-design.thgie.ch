# Unboxing the Voice Assistants
Dezember 2020

One point of insight was an unboxing observation I did with

- [Person bKEfGP](data/people/Person%20bKEfGP.md)
- [Person bc9PVK](data/people/Person%20bc9PVK.md)
- [Person oPJ3Mv](data/people/Person%20oPJ3Mv.md)

The goal for the participants was to successfully setup the [Google Nest Mini](Google%20Nest%20Mini). I was trying to capture what was going within the user through an empathy map and doing a user journey.

## Empathy Map
User: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels (Emotion and Senses)

## User Journey
User wants to setup a Google Nest Mini. I want to capture how the users goes about that and what kind of relationship this unboxing initiates.

- *Motivation*. Why are they trying to do it?
- *Actions*. The actual behaviors and steps taken by users.
- *Pain points*. What are the challenges users are facing?
