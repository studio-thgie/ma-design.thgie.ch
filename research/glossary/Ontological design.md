# Ontological design
Derived from the philosophy of Heidegger, ontological design essentials says, that what we design, designs us back.

> "ontological designing is a way of characterising the relation between human beings and lifeworlds." (Willis 2006:69)

> "• that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; • that designing is fundamental to being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); • that this adds up to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us." (Willis 2006:69)
