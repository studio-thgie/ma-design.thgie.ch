# Actor-network theory (ANT)
> Actorâ€“network theory (ANT) is a theoretical and methodological approach to social theory where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationships. It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. 

Actor-network theory treats non-human objects and things, such as doorknobs, keys, tables, the weather, electricity, ferns, sandwiches, cockroaches, bookcovers, elevator buttons, port standards, APIs and others as actants within socio-material networks.

Is related to [Ontological design](research/glossary/Ontological%20design.md) and [New Materialism](research/glossary/New%20Materialism.md).
