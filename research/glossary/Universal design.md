# Universal design
A different [[User-centered design|user-centered design]] model is *universal design*, which again centers on users, but with the added framing of designing for the most diverse range of users possible. UD has not been conceived as a one-size-fits-all approach. It does not reduce multiple personas to an average but takes people's actual needs into account. It just takes as many needs into account as possible [@WhatUniversalDesign]. UD came not into existence through designers' practices but was driven through processes in liberal political, economic, and scientific structures concerned with defining the disabled user and designing for them.
