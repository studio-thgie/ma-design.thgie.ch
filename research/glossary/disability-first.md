# disability-first
The term assumes that assistive interfaces are often workarounds for lifeworlds, content or processes designed for able-bodied and neuro-typical people. A disability-first interface would start from the perspective of people with impairments.

A simplified example would be the comparison between embossed letters and braille. Embossed letters would be a workout to make a text accessible, but with high costs in terms of effort for people with seeing impairments. Braille is much easier to read and would be a disability-first interface to access a given text.
