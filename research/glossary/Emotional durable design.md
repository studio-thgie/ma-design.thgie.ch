# Emotionally durable design (EDD)
Emotionally durable design is interested in our relations to products and forming strong bonds with them.

> 'Emotionally Durable Design poses two key questions: "Why do we throw away products that still work?" and "How can we design products that people want to keep for longer?" It analyses our patterns of consumption and waste, and successfully offers strategies and tools which can act as an alternative to our ‘throwaway society’. Emotional durability is vital to creating designs that people love and cherish, instead of simply making products to be thrown away.
