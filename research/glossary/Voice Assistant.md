# Voice Assistant
Voice assistants are technologies that create a dialogical, spoken interface with computational ressources. Input can be made in the form of a command ([Utterance](research/glossary/Utterance.md)) and the output is spoken back by the device or software. There are usually no visual or material interfaces with voice assistants. All exchanges are made via audio interface.
