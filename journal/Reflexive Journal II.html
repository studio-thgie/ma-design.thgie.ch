        <p>In this second iteration, I tried to build up themes from the
        codes and labels I applied to the data before. This process
        involves going through the codes and see if some can fit
        together under an umbrella theme.</p>
        <p>In a first attempt I produced around 35 themes, which are way
        to much for the thematic analysis approach. There is no fixed
        number proposed either, but I saw between 4 to 6 mentioned at a
        few places. So I tried to merge the themes down, which was a
        painful process (kill your darlings), but it somehow worked out
        quite well. Unintentionally the themes can be put into a nice
        relationship.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>As an intermediary result I can say, that I couldn’t locate
        any animistic weak signals in my interviews and observations. I
        hoped otherwise but was prepared that this could fail. Depening
        on the framework, certain aspects could be interpreted
        animistic, but not necessary intentional by the user. Especially
        the concept of uncertainity by Betto Marenko could apply.</p>
        <p>I was rather hopeing, that I find weak signals more towards
        the psychological aspects, as in the research of Piaget on
        animism in children, where these perceive the world around them
        as alive and meaningful.</p>
        <p>On the other hand I found more then a handful of pain points
        in the different user journeys and human-machine interactions,
        and that is something, no? For now I’m happy with the material
        and especially the themes with which I want to work in a next
        phase now.</p>
        <p><strong>The themes that I’m left with.</strong></p>
        <h2 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h2>
        <h3 id="conditioning-the-user---user"><a
        href="output/themes/Conditioning%20the%20User.html">Conditioning
        the User</a> - User</h3>
        <p>More often then not, the user has to be conditioned into way
        of communicating or behaving with the assistant as according to
        the manufacturer and developer of the device and assistant.</p>
        <h3 id="what-is-a-voice-assistant---assistant"><a
        href="output/themes/What%20is%20a%20voice%20assistant.html">What
        is a voice assistant</a> - Assistant</h3>
        <p>Starting with how to address the assistant and ending with
        the further disolvement of work and leisure, the users are
        generally unsure what they actually bought.</p>
        <h3 id="questions-of-scale---ecosystem"><a
        href="output/themes/Questions%20of%20scale.html">Questions of
        scale</a> - Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>A voice assistant is unthinkable without the global systems
        of big tech in the background, to which it is always attached.
        This links the private with the corporate, the small with the
        big, the cheap devices with our planetary ecological crisis.</p>
        <h2 id="the-in-between-the-stakeholders">The in between the
        stakeholders</h2>
        <h3 id="communication-language-and-behavior"><a
        href="output/themes/Communication,%20Language%20and%20Behavior.html">Communication,
        Language and Behavior</a></h3>
        <p>There are very specific ways of communicating and behaving
        involved in the interactions between user and assistant, which
        are unique to this context.</p>
        <h2 id="posthuman-subjectivity">Posthuman Subjectivity</h2>
        <p>These two themes maybe go beyond the scope of this project,
        but they are nonetheless of interest. ### <a
        href="output/themes/Control%20and%20convenience.html">Control and
        convenience</a> The practices around voice assistants are
        intimately linked to the control of the immediate environment,
        usually the home, as well as preserving resources, usually time
        and physical energy. This practices change us, and thus, what it
        means to be us. ### <a
        href="output/themes/Knowledge%20Practices.html">Knowledge
        Practices</a> A continuation of knowledge practices since the
        advent of digital media; A voice assistant is also an enormous
        database, backed by the internet. Not one question, that can’t
        be answer by the assistant. And that is paralleled by the
        assistant’s ability to relieve us of our mental burdens of
        thinking and remembering.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The first four themes will find their way into the <a
        href="research/designs/Expert%20Workshop%20I.html">Expert Workshop
        I</a>. But before that, I will have to flesh them out and add
        the different nuances. Thank to the wiki system, the themes have
        already backlinks to the codes that belong to a theme. I often
        wrote a sentence or two for a code to make it better
        understandable. The code itself then is linked to the piece of
        data it springs from. Unfortunately, in the web-version, the
        browser doesn’t jump to the specific point in the interview or
        observation.</p>
