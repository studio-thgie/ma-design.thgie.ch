        <h1 id="process-1st-semester">Process 1st Semester</h1>
        <p>Feb 05, 2020</p>
        <p>In this entry I would love to briefly capture the state of
        the project and the process so far. Just half a year into my
        studies and everything is different, it seems.</p>
        <h2 id="what-did-i-start-with-again">What did I start with
        again?</h2>
        <p>My initial intention, doing this project-driven master, was
        to work with the subject of animism as well as technology, their
        entanglement from the viewpoint of design research. I guessed,
        design research is a bit more researchy then art research and I
        liked that thought. Turns out, I was absolutely right about that
        - but of course that brought some problems with it, that I was
        not prepared for.</p>
        <p>I wasn’t aware how deeply I was already within the
        <em>cool</em> critical theory and anthropocene art stuff. Just
        arriving with my premises of course wouldn’t work. I was very
        lucky to have Luiza Prado and Robert Lziscar as mentors and next
        to being amazing mirrors, I was able to talk about the weak
        points of my approaches and premises.</p>
        <h2 id="and-what-came-then">And what came then?</h2>
        <p>Next to learn how I can position myself within the design
        research context I learned a lot about objects and things and
        new materialism. One of the weakest points of my project was,
        that I wanted to work with animism without actually having
        access to it, respectifely to the practitioners. I operated more
        from the western idea or idealisation of animism, and not much
        with what animism actually means in reality. So I tried to
        reframe and translate what I actually mean when I reference
        animism. Again, Luiza Prado was a big help here.</p>
        <p>Next to remove my bias I also had to learn to be less
        solution-driven in my research questions.</p>
        <p><strong>What I could extract from my interest in animism is
        actually simply the caring and respectful relationship to the
        material world in particular the objects and things we interact
        with on a daily base.</strong></p>
        <p>So we have the keywords <em>relationship</em>, <em>care and
        respect</em> as well as <em>objects/things</em>. That gave me a
        lot of material to research. What was missing was a use case. In
        one of the meetings, the mobile phone popped up and it made a
        lot of sense to me. I worked on mobile phone, or it’s
        electronical waste, before. So my research question started to
        evolve around what our relationship with our mobile phone is,
        after all. I invested quite a while on trying different
        approaches to how this question could be formed.</p>
        <h2 id="the-end-of-the-first-semester">The end of the first
        semester</h2>
        <p>Im read quite a lot of papers and articles on the different
        keywords I extracted earlier as well as the combination of them,
        always trying to stay close to design research. That was
        fruitful, but didn’t help me evolve my research question.</p>
        <p>I wasn’t to happy with my research question after weeks of
        trying out different focii. I had the problem of framing the
        question in a way that it</p>
        <ul>
        <li>stays true to my intentions</li>
        <li>is within the focus of my studies</li>
        <li>is actionable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also was very insecure if this makes sense at all or if it
        is realizeable. My mentor gave me some good tips. I probably
        worked to long on it already and should have done some actual
        practical research meanwhile. Or extract a smaller question I
        could try to answer.</p>
        <p>But, what was the most important aspect after all was that my
        case study with the mobile phone didn’t make me to happy. It was
        to big and I also feared, that it was to close to another recent
        research project that focues on repair culture around the mobile
        phone. My mentor came up with Apple’s Airpods and despite it not
        being my own idea, I utterly love it.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Airpods are not to long and not to short on the
        market</li>
        <li>Their technological scope and use case is much smaller then
        the those of mobile phones and they don’t have the software
        baggage</li>
        <li>They’re nasty little things and add up mighty to the
        ecological crisis by being irrepairable and unusable after just
        two years, and that despite the need for tech companies to act
        more sustainable</li>
        <li>Their rise to stardom is quite interesting</li>
        <li>They have some interesting implications for social
        behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So Airpods it is! I’d love to go into a direction of <a
        href="https://anatomyof.ai/">Anatomy of an AI System</a>. I
        definitly need to learn a bit more about ANT.</p>
        <h2 id="my-position">My position</h2>
        <p>During this semester I also tried to develop a proper
        position from which I act as a research.</p>
        <p><strong>While capitalism took away the necessity to care for
        things, design took away the possibility to form a caring
        relationship to things.</strong></p>
        <p>I will maybe expand on that another time.</p>
        <h2 id="animism">Animism?</h2>
        <p>The spirit of animism is still alive within the core of my
        research question or case study, but it became more entangled,
        less simple. It’s not anymore about my personal relationship to
        an object, but about many relationships between many things. The
        care part lays a bit low right now but is included in the
        hypothesis and I somehow have the feeling that it will flare up
        again.</p>
