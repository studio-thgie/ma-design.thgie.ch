description: "Doing participatory research during a pandemy often is reduced to a minimum. I was able to work around the limitations with a handfull of additional expert interviews to discuss voice assistants as assistive technologies and my hypothesis. This way, I could make up a bit not being able to work directly with blind people."

# It's interviews all the way down
During my last semester I worked mainly through expert interviews, five in numbers, to be specific. The first set in August and September focused on understanding the place assistive tech and voice assistants play in the life of people with impairments. The last two interviews were specificly hovering around voice assistants as assistive tech for blind people.

Where as the first set helped me setup the research focus the second helped me validate my hypothesis to a certain degree.
