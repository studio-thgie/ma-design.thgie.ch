        <p>Apr 30, 2020</p>
        <p>The second semester is amongst other things focusing on
        preliminary research. Besides an extensive literature review I
        tried to implement a first approach to applied research. As
        discussed with my coach, I concentrated on Apple’s AirPods as a
        technological artifact.</p>
        <p>My intention was to investigate what relationship people have
        to this object, what values and assumptions are going into that
        relationship. As a short reminder: I’m generally interested in
        how design can push users to a better care-practice of
        technological artifacts.</p>
        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <h3 id="observation">Observation</h3>
        <p>After deciding on the use case I first wanted to get a
        general overview of the demographics of users, which would
        inform who I chose to interview. I had a rough idea where I
        could setup camp from preliminary attentiveness in public space.
        There seem to be roughly two age groups that wear AirPods in
        public.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Late teenagers</li>
        <li>Young adults</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I could target the first group through a setup in a McDonalds
        shortly after working-hours and the later in a setup during the
        day in a co-working space. I sadly lost my notes from the
        co-working space. But here would be the data of the McDonalds
        session.</p>
        <p>A basic takeaway from the observation sessions were, that
        AirPods minimally disturb social relations in public space
        through the invasiveness in social interactions. Especially when
        the participants of an exchange don’t know each other, the
        knowledge that the other can hear us is important. There are no
        indicators visible to the non-wearer, if the wearer of AirPods
        is present in listening or not.</p>
        <h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>
        <p>I setup the interview in order to listen to users of AirPods
        to talk about their relationship with the artifact. I wanted to
        collect a vocabulary, other then my own, to talk about said
        relationship. The interviews were semi-structured and went along
        the following guidelines.</p>
        <h4 id="leitfaden">Leitfaden</h4>

        </ul>

        <p>The interview was two-parted, where as the first part was the
        classical semi-structured discussion on aspect of feelings and
        handlings of the airpods and the second part was a free
        discussion on the implications of problematic material used in
        the AirPods, after a brief presentation on said material.</p>
        <p>I did 6 interviews, 4 with participants who own and use
        AirPods and 2 with participants who do not own AirPods.</p>
        <p>I have yet to review the interviews again, but generally I
        have to say that I was too biased in my approach, or to
        demanding what I wanted from the interviews. I searched for a
        reflected view on the subject and participants who could answer
        or discuss reflected but didn’t include those aspects when I
        searched for interviewees. Nonetheless, the interviews were
        interesting and rich in findings.</p>
        <p>Main takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Apple’s AirPods are brilliant in their technology and
        usage</li>
        <li>Generally, they are seen as dumb-looking</li>
        <li>The users are not aware of the problematic (in terms of
        environmental damage) materials used</li>
        <li>The users do not know how to care for or clean the AirPods,
        but also don’t care about that lack of knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the interview were recorded on video.</p>
        <h4 id="rpg-interview">RPG Interview</h4>
        <p>Since I’m preoccupied with the question on animistic design,
        and how it would influence a care-practice, I tried to do an
        experimental interview. The method of roleplaying in design
        research is nothing new, but usually takes inspiration from
        theater. I wanted to have a setup, where the participant is
        emotionally more invested. Therefor I took inspiration from pen
        and paper roleplaying games. A few factors are beneficial to my
        approach:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Player creates their own persona to be played in the
        game</li>
        <li>Player is encouraged to actively decide what is
        happening</li>
        <li>Player is encouraged to actively co-create the world</li>
        <li>Complete fictional worlds allow for greater
        storytelling/story-making approaches</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With two separate participants I played out a short 15-minute
        segment in which the player’s sister is kidnapped by a robot.
        The world in which this is happening, Tales from the Loop, is
        described as the 80ies but with some technological advanced
        which push technology right into the magical. The players in
        this world occupy personas of kids. After a short chase and a
        dramatic scene, the robot and the sister leave behind and
        artifact, which delivers an audio-connection to the sister. It
        is basically in it’s functionality very close to AirPods - but I
        let the player complete control over how the artifact is
        actually designed.</p>
        <p>This method was interesting from a speculative standpoint to
        generate the design of an object from a highly emotional and
        individualistic point of view.</p>
        <h3 id="cultural-probe">Cultural Probe</h3>
        <p>I wanted to do a cultural probe with a pair of AirPods and a
        participant, who did not formerly own and use AirPods or similar
        technology. Unfortunately the pair broke down before the
        participant could start with the tasks given. I would have loved
        to see the results and might consider to repeat the approach
        once more.</p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>To setup methods is not easy and this has to be carefully
        reflected. I consider myself lucky, that the interviews are
        still rich in findings. The same counts for the observation:
        Without a clear frame of what and who should be observed, there
        is not much value in doing it.</p>
        <p>I will do a rephrasing on what I’m looking for in the
        interviews before I review them. I might consider concentrating
        on one simple aspect, for example their knowledge of care and
        cleaning for the AirPods. I also have to listen closely to what
        has not been said.</p>
        <p>The experimental approach was very interesting and I would
        love to use this method for research in the future as a think or
        discussion piece. I see a lot of potential for pen and paper rpg
        driven workshops for collaborative story-making and discussion
        drivers.</p>
