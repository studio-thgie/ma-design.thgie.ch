        <p>Mar 13, 2020</p>
        <p>The <em>Design Criticism</em> Workshop was short, filled with
        fruitful discussions and two interesting outputs. I could
        persuade my team-members, Pauline and Karla, to focus on the
        design of technology and how it interferes with our lives. In
        the first exercise, we tried to critique digital technology and
        how it invades our time, unquestioned of its attempt to optimize
        our time. Thus the <em>Manifesto on Time</em> was born.</p>
        <p>For our second exercise, in which we could sketch a
        speculative design project, I already had a plan what I would
        love to do. The Cycle Bowl is an amalgam of the complete removal
        of digital technology from a task, that is done with digital
        technology these days, and the wish to put it into a
        <em>beautiful</em> companion object. The project is inspired by
        my partners desire to know, where she is in her menstrual cycle,
        in order to start with a regime of herbal remedies to soften the
        blow of the period.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>I liked the speculative aspects of both exercises. I was
        restraining myself from doing speculative tasks up to now, since
        I felt, that with that I just would take the easy way in this
        project. But I learned, that for now Iâ€™m researching on two
        fronts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>status quo of our relationship to consumer tech</li>
        <li>a utopic relationship to consumer tech, inspired by
        shintoism</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will continue to work on both threads and see where I will
        be able to bring them together.</p>
