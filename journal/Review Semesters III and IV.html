        <h2 id="initial-position">Initial Position</h2>
        <p>During the second year in my Master I tried to translate ways
        of treating technological artifacts as quasi-social actants into
        design research. During this process I needed to revise my
        original hypothesis as well as the accompanying
        research-questions.</p>
        <p>Initially I was heavily invested into the subject of animism,
        especially aspects of it coming from contemporary anthropology
        and philosophy. Animism basically means, that something is
        perceived as animated, be that physically or on a
        epistemological level. The hypothesis I built circled around the
        notion of improved relationship to consumer technology with a
        positive impact on ecology through less trashed electronics. I
        wanted to pursue this path by introducing concious practices of
        treating things as animated.</p>
        <p>I settled on voice assistants, like Amazon’s Echo or Google’s
        Nest, as study case. It is a disruptive technology, which just
        recently established itself for good. It hasn’t been studied
        thoroughly already, bringing with it many research gaps to be
        filled as well as potentials to be looted. The aspect of
        speaking with it also brings added benefits if going the path of
        animism.</p>
        <h2 id="whats-been-done">What’s been done</h2>
        <p>With this in mind I carved the <a
        href="journal/Researchplan%202020.html">following research
        plan</a>, built up in three consecutive phases.</p>
        <p><em>Phase 1</em> - Fieldwork: Interviews with user as well as
        observatory participation, user journeys, capturing online
        voices through product reviews and forum discussions as well as
        collect image material related to customizing voice assistants
        as well as advertisement - Thematic analysis of the material</p>
        <p><em>Phase 2</em> - Expert Workshop with designers in order to
        conceive prototype-able material, building on a animistic
        framework as well as the research data from phase 1 -
        Prototyping of possible animistic approaches to voice
        assistants</p>
        <p><em>Phase 3</em> - Testing Prototypes</p>
        <p>The whole process was accompanied by ongoing literature
        review as well as discussions with experts from philosophy and
        anthropology, since the the aspects of animism I was
        particullarly interested in proved hard to translate into design
        research. That might also had to do with my approach…</p>
        <p>I want to go briefly into the important bits. In Phase 1 I
        wanted to concentrate on finding weak signals that point to
        animist practices. An animist practice would be an act or
        behavior that treats a thing as animated or alive with a focus
        on acknowledging and respecting the other-than-human. Examples
        of this can be found in other cultures and communities, for
        example some ritual practice the Japanese Shinto religion, where
        animist practices are consciously cultivated. I hoped I could
        find traces of something similar here.</p>
        <p>This was not the case. Within the interviews I could do as
        well as the many hours of observation, no such conscious
        behavior was found or mentioned. What I found where ample
        examples of problems in the communication with the voice
        assistants. In many cases I found the voice assistant treated as
        a quasi-social actant, which is not necessarily surprising,
        given that we talk with them. The depths of it may be
        illustrated by the following excerpts. I asked an interviewee to
        describe the device or assistant in their own words:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Ok… I would have said like an imposter. Like a little alien,
        which is kind of … like a plastic-alien cylinder that spies in
        here a little bit and listens a little bit and then every now
        and then, I don’t know. I watched a tv show once, and they
        mentioned the name Alexa all the time and she was like
        <em>mimimi</em>, wanted to give her two cents all the time. And
        I was like, dude, stop it! Yeah, just a bit of a nag.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Another participant told me how he sometimes kicks his Amazon
        Echo device out of frustration. He further expanded</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>It would be nice if there really was a reaction, I mean, I
        say “Alexa, you asshole” quite often. And there’s just no
        reaction. […] nothing happens. And that’s frustrating. You can
        swear on her as much as you want, but nothing happens.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Both positions, coming from the assistant as well as the
        user, indicate behavior that is hard to tolerate and point to
        problems of human-computer-interaction and communication.</p>

        collecting</a></p>
        <p>The collected material was transcribed into the research
        archive, which also built the base for the thematic
        analysis.</p>
        <p>TA is a classical method of labeling your data or coding it
        and then developing overlapping themes out of the codes. I opted
        for a reflexive approach after Braun and Clarke as it lends
        itself to mixed media data analysis. An important aspect of this
        method is the back-linking of codes and themes to the actual
        data, and thus verify and making sure the analysis has
        substance. Thematic analysis is said to be compatible with
        phenomenology in that it can focus on participants’ subjective
        experiences and sense-making, which was important for me, as I
        strived towards the field of user experience and interaction
        design. In the reflexive approach the researcher’s active part
        in the creation of theme is important. Themes are not emerging
        but are actively generated, created and constructed.</p>
        <p>Further reading -&gt; <a
        href="output/Thematic%20Analysis.html">Thematic Analysis</a></p>
        <p>After not finding the hoped-for weak signals of animist
        practice in the field work, the thematic analysis concentrated
        mainly on aspects of communication. I developed six themes all
        in all, 4 of which I pursued further. The themes mainly circled
        around issues of unnatural communication as well as trust and
        privacy issues. Three of them concerned the different main
        actants or stakeholders, the users, the devices and the brands
        behind the devices. The fourth theme concentrated on the
        communication and behavior between these three parties.</p>

        <p><em><a
        href="output/themes/Conditioning%20the%20User.html">Conditioning
        the User</a></em> Despite being a natural way of interaction,
        the user still need to heavily adapt speech and behavior in
        favor of the machine.</p>

        href="output/themes/What%20is%20a%20voice%20assistant.html">What
        is a voice assistant</a></em> Users are often not very sure what
        a voice assistant actually is, or how to address or behave
        towards it.</p>
        <p><em><a
        href="output/themes/Questions%20of%20scale.html">Questions of
        scale</a></em> Most users are aware, that it is only a minuscule
        part of a gigantic, planet-spanning infrastructure. Though they
        hardly ever can imagine the true size of it. And that there is
        always a companies intention behind them.</p>
        <p><em><a
        href="output/themes/Communication,%20Language%20and%20Behavior.html">Communication,
        Language and Behavior</a></em> It could be argued, that all
        technologies need the user to adapt to them in a certain way.
        That is not necessarily a natural, given thing. In the case of
        voice assistants we sometimes have to go extrem ways to
        accomodate this technology.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>During the thematic analysis, the once important animism,
        finally fell out of focus. After not finding it as weak signals
        in the field work and not appearing in the thematic analysis, it
        needed to be dropped as main part from the hypothesis. But I
        only realized this later on.</p>
        <p>I prepared the material, the themes, as well as excerpts from
        the data and image material for the workshop. I was lucky enough
        to be able to hold the workshop in real life, as all the
        participants agreed to meet in physical space. To be able to
        concentrate during the workshop I produced a research zine from
        the material which functioned as presentation of said material
        as well as a working tool.</p>
        <p>I further added material from two frameworks which were very
        helpful in conveying my approach. The first was the neo-animist
        framework by Betti Marenko, which introduces four categories for
        animist design - agency, embodiment, ecology and uncertainty.
        Coming from philosophy, these categories are not directly
        translatable into a practice, but they help to think about and
        analyze design in animist ways. The second framework is by
        Jonathan Chapman and is called emotionally durable design. It
        proposes nine categories that can be directly applied in design
        to enable stronger emotional bonds, one of which is
        “consciousness” which can be aligned with Marenko’s agency as
        well as uncertainty.</p>
        <p>The aim of the expert workshop was to imagine prototypes.
        These were to be based on my research framework as well as the
        field findings and had the aim to improve the relationship
        between users and voice assistant. I invited four different
        people coming from four different design disciplines. Included
        were industrial design, service design, somebody working mainly
        with text and communication and a person coming from ceramic
        craft. I wanted to have different perspectives on the same
        material.</p>
        <p>I had two threads built into the workshop. The first was
        about bringing the different positions together. This thread was
        organized by starting with silent solo-exercises going towards
        more discursive group exercises. The second thread was about
        opening up the imagination. I borrowed heavily from speculative
        and future design exercises. Both threads culminated into a
        final task of shared world-building. It was important for the
        process, that the problem found in the fieldwork were not looked
        at from an engineering point of view, but from said design
        perspectives, and how these imagine alternatives to the
        contemporary practices that I recorded.</p>
        <p>In the final exercise I asked the participants to speculate
        about how our relationship to voice assistants looks like in the
        next 15 to 20 years and write a story or text about that and
        further, to tell this story. I found the stories and their
        content extremely inspiring and they took up a few very valid
        point on how to go forward. Nonetheless, a clear path was not
        visible. The hope-for prototypes didn’t emerge.</p>

        of Expert Workshop</a></p>
        <p>What came after was nothing short of an existential crisis
        towards the project, it’s focus and goals. I ruminated on that
        in</p>
        <ul>

        Conjunctions</a></li>

        Phase</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The basic problem was, if it is not about animism, what is it
        then? And what do I actually want to do?</p>
        <p>With the help of my coach I started a reflectory process in
        which I attempted to reframe the project. I needed to continue
        were I left of, but change the questions and hypothesis
        drastically. This was not very easy for me, as the subject of
        animism is dear to me and I wanted to have it in the focus. It
        is a personal project linked to my past. Another problem was
        also, that the project was tied up in accomodating a future PhD
        which added layers of complexity to this process.</p>
        <p>A first draft went into the direction of using voice
        assistants, or digital assistans per se, in the application of
        therapy as supporting tools. A draft for that can be found in <a
        href="journal/Digital%20Companions%20in%20Therapeutic%20Settings.html">Digital
        Companions in Therapeutic Settings</a>. This outline was
        welcomed by my coach and peers. It made sense. After further
        introspection and talks with experts I needed to be honest about
        it. Working this direction would have made sense as a new
        project, but jump into it that late, without having any
        experience in the field wasn’t working out. I also got advised
        that there are many institutions and companies with quite enough
        money already on track with this. A brief research over the
        landscape of available apps confirmed that.</p>
        <p>Luckily I started to read <em>Relating to Things</em>, a book
        on technology like voice assistants, thought about through a
        post-penomenological lense. If phenomenology is concerned about
        how our perception builds our understanding of the world,
        post-phenomenology is concerned with how technology mediates
        that perception. If the former is interested in how you see
        things, the later is interested in your glases.</p>
        <p>One chapter is focusing on issues of privacy, which can be
        remated as intimacy from a user perspective. I found this link
        quite fitting, as I encountered it in my field research quite a
        bit. I also saw a possible way forward in experimenting with the
        two frameworks of Betti Marenko and Jonathan Chapman to
        investigate and better the experience the interaction between
        user and voice assistant.</p>
        <p>I outlined a draft for this approach here <a
        href="output/Negotiating%20Privacy%20with%20Voice%20Assistants.html">Negotiating
        Privacy with Voice Assistants</a>.</p>
        <p>The possed problem seemed singular enough to be researched
        through a prototypial approach, but also expandable into more
        questions. That’s were I am right now. As for the moment I
        started with building up the development plattform, with which I
        can setup up experiments.</p>
