        <p>As mentioned, the biggest take away from the last course was,
        that working with <em>animism</em> as a concept might prove
        diffult for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It’s not something I have easy access to, and working from
        beyond a community of practitioners is not something I should or
        want to do</li>
        <li>How the fuck should I ever generate any
        <em>non-spiritual</em> use cases from this :D</li>
        <li>The discourse is in its infacy here, while it’s something in
        practice elsewhere since millenia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I tried to shift to a similar discourse, namely new
        materialism, in an attempt to word out the base of my research
        project. I wrote a short text about that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="output/Agency%20within%20the%20%20context%20of%20new%20materialism.html">Agency
        within the context of new materialism</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After two coachings, with Robert and Luiza (and a
        mini-coaching by Ulrike Felsing), I also figured that I should
        not concentrate too much on the discourse basis in the
        beginning, but try to get into a practice as soon as possible –
        getting concrete.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to be concrete, I speculated about possible
        <em>solutions</em> to the problem of our relations to our
        things. There is a fragmentary text about that exercise, as well
        as a critique on an attempt to use <em>animism</em> in design
        research:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="output/Design%20and%20New%20Materialism%20-%20Possible%20approaches.html">Design
        and New Materialism - Possible approaches</a></li>
        <li><a
        href="output/On%20the%20Application%20of%20Animism%20in%20Design.html">On
        the Application of Animism in Design</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>One thing I liked a lot from the coaching with Luiza was,
        that my work with <em>animism</em> might be an attempt to find a
        language for something I know from experience. From this whole
        process I singled out one aspect I’m especially interested
        in:</p>
