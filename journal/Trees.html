        <p>The seminar, lead by Dr. Hanspeter Znoy, looked at how
        capitalist relations arrive in pre-capitalist communities as
        well as those pushed to the margins of society, like fugitives,
        minorities or the poor.</p>
        <p>We looked at these processes through three Books by two
        authors. <strong>Land’s End</strong> by <strong>Tania
        Li</strong> and <strong>Friction</strong> and <strong>Mushroom
        at the End of the World</strong> by <strong>Anna Tsing</strong>.
        Especially the later was why I wanted to visit this seminar.
        Anna Tsing’s work introduced me to a special kind of branch of
        anthropology, the multispecies or more-than-human
        enthography.</p>
        <p>In the seminar’s final essay I wanted to look at the language
        applied in the three books. The first two books played out in
        the forrests and jungles of indonesia and the last one was about
        the global supply chain of the matsutake mushroom. Since
        <em>trees</em> featured heavily in all three books, I took that
        as the measure, through which I analyzed the applied language.
        For that I looked at every single instance of the word tree and
        codified it’s usage as well as the surrounding context.</p>

        - Social Life in Capitalist Ruins</a></p>
        <p>I must say, that I’m happy with the findings, to see how
        values, worldviews and theory of the different authors are
        mirrored within their unconscious application of language of a
        single concept. I also love how this exercise brought the three
        books even closer.</p>
