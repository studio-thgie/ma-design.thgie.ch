        Technosphere(s)</h1>
        <p>Jan 20, 2020</p>
        <p>I visited the third event in the Distortion series at HEAD in
        Geneva, organised be the master on media design. The focus was
        on digital technologies and the ecological crisis from a
        perspective of design.</p>
        <p>The event was structered as a mini-conference, giving 5
        practitioners the possibility to show their process in a
        selected project. It was clearly aimed for students. Sadly,
        there were no organized possibilities to interact with the
        speakers, except for the after-event drink. I already knew
        Vanessa Lorenzo or was at least familiar with her work. She
        contacted me beforehand to discuss two upcoming projects of
        hers.</p>
        <p>I made many notes but couldn’t distill anything of value for
        my own project yet.</p>
        <h3
        id="alexandre-monnin---the-closings-worlds-initiative">Alexandre
        Monnin - The Closings Worlds Initiative</h3>
        <p>Monnin presented the Closing Worls Initiative. It’s a project
        that acts with on the premises that there are many legacy
        worlds, that are not adequat anymore - the long tail of
        technologies for example - and how these words can be shut down
        in a responsible manner.</p>
        <p>On the other hand the projects works with real client on the
        prospects, that ecological changes make them or their products
        obsolete, for example in snow-less winters nobody will buy
        skis.</p>
        <p>Their aim is to reclaim obsolescence: “How do we prevent more
        objects to appear, how do we make less things exist?”</p>
        <h3
        id="xandra-van-der-eijk---the-landscape-of-unintended-consequences">Xandra
        Van Der Eijk - The landscape of unintended consequences</h3>
        <p>Van der Eijks work concentrated on seaweed as raw material
        for design, in example to color fabrics. She showed then, how
        the dam system in the Netherlands accidently lead to a new and
        thriving ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Her projects were very strong on a material and aesthetic
        side, which were quite pleasant to consume and very interesting
        from a communication design perspective.</p>
        <h3 id="irene-stracuzzi---the-legal-status-of-ice">Irene
        Stracuzzi - The Legal Status of Ice</h3>
        <p>Stracuzzi is a grafic designer with a focus on ethical
        design. She investigated the melting ice in the arctic and how
        the bordering states want to lay claim to the sea floor. The
        most important thing in this battle is data.</p>
        <p>She realised a project in which this battle as well as the
        ecological implications are physically shown.</p>
        <h3
        id="gaulthier-roussilhe---framing-digital-practices-into-planetary-limits">Gaulthier
        Roussilhe - Framing digital practices into planetary limits</h3>
        <p>Roussilhe’s project was by far the most interesting to me. He
        investigated how the internet contributes to co2 level as well
        as the energy expenditure. Based on current data, he showed how
        the internet is responsible for quite a chunk of co2 especially
        the consumption of video.</p>
        <p>He introduced then the idea of thinking in budgets of co2 and
        energy (W) instead of monetary values. Taking that idea head on,
        he further calculated the costs of a single visit to his website
        and as a reaction, limited visits to it to 5000 a month.</p>
        <h3 id="vanessa-lorenzo---hybrids">Vanessa Lorenzo -
        Hybrid(s)</h3>
        <p>Lorenzo investigated two different epistemological systems
        and juxtaposed them in a speculative design work. During a
        residency in South Africa she had close looks at the Near Earth
        Astroid warning system as well as the millenia old culture of
        using rocks as sound and memory devices, by the san people.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>What I took from the event was, that designers are closely
        investigating what technology means in this time of ecological
        crisis. While some want to abolish unsustainable technology,
        others are imposing limits on what it is allowed to do. Some
        even try to expand the notion of what technology means.</p>
