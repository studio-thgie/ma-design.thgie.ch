        <p><em>A post-phenomenological approach to voice assistants</em>
        <small>Mar 21, 2021</small></p>
        <p>After two and a half coaching, a project club, and lots of
        discussions with my peers; Here’s where I’m at.</p>
        <p>I reached an end with the path I walked before. My interest
        layed in the application of animism in the design of our
        relationship to technology, in order to strengthen bonds, and
        thus to lessen the ecological impact on the planet (through
        production and electronic waste).</p>
        <p>After a brief look at smartphones as well as cordless
        headphones I then decided to invest research mainly into voice
        assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa. How I went about that can be
        read in the <a
        href="journal/Researchplan%202020.html">Researchplan 2020</a>.
        Parallel I invested a lot of energy into literature review as
        well as deep readings, since the topic of animism was quite hard
        to grasp and even harder to convey.</p>
        <p>Those two threads culminated into a blockade of sorts after
        the expert workshop. I couldn’t move forward in the way I
        planned. That moment was captured in <a
        href="journal/Crossroads%20and%20Conjunctions.html">Crossroads and
        Conjunctions</a> and <a
        href="journal/Post-Animism%20Phase.html">Post-Animism
        Phase</a>.</p>
        <p>After what I saw in the field, I’m having a hard time to work
        with the two main user-segments of voice assistants; home
        automation enthusiasts and consumer electronics casuals. The
        problem here is not that there is a unhealthy user-machine
        relationship; It is that this technology is completely
        unnecessary in the first place. Nonetheless the technology has a
        rapid and high adoption rate, so there must be something behind
        it. I then need to ask myself the question, where does it make
        sense and where do I want to invest my energy.</p>
        <p>On the side of animism I reconciled that it is not something
        that can be designed into product, but that I emerges out of
        lived practices. Animism is a shared and learned way of seeing
        the world. Through the work of Betti Marenko it also becomes a
        great tool for the analysis of technology, as seen in <em>When
        toys come to life: Considering the internet of toys from an
        animistic design</em>. This point should probably be expanded as
        a finding.</p>
        <p>Next to these elaborated points, there are also the following
        issues with the current application of voice assistant
        technology</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Sexism and colonial practices; As layed out in <em>Preparing
        for smart voice assistants: Cultural histories and media
        innovations</em>, VAs became popular by conciously designing
        submissive female personas into them. The VAs then becomes a
        trojan horse to invade and colonize our most private and sacred
        spaces.</li>
        <li>Trust and Closed Sources; <a
        href="research/glossary/GAFA.html">GAFA</a> are interested in our
        data, and only secondly in our lifes. Everything that touches us
        this intimately should be designed with a different perspective
        on privacy to begin with.</li>
        <li>Ungenerous and Inefficient Interfaces; Everything you can do
        with a voice assistant you can do quicker with an app on a
        smartphone. The voice interface is also completely
        intransparently in what you can and can’t do with it, further
        clouding it’s inner workings of collecting data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I finally decided to continue working with the technology,
        but with and through a user-segment that seems meaningful to me
        and with an approach that steps away from the classical
        command-response paradigm. Voice user interfaces have a very low
        threshold of acceptance and technical skills. They further have
        the advantage of being hands-free, which is supportive of people
        with mobility or visibility impairments. I want to take up that
        part, technology as being supportive of being in the world. The
        approach of voice assistants as digital companions can be
        further developed to apply to people in forced isolation or in
        therapy. Seen through a post-phenomenological approach,
        artificial companions have the ability to preserve dignity while
        enabling autonomy. This point needs clarification from my side;
        But for now it’s important to stress, that I don’t see voice
        assistants as replacements for human to human relations,
        especially within therapeutic settings. I do believe that this
        technology holds supportive potential if integrated in
        therapeutic programs.</p>
