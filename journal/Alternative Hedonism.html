        <p>Thoughts on <a
        href="texts/The%20Trouble%20with%20Consumption%20-%20Kate%20Soper.html">The
        Trouble with Consumption - Kate Soper</a>.</p>
        <p>Alternative hedonism is a view on the consumer opposing the
        liberal as well as the marxist analysis of this persona. While
        still being political, it focuses on the implications and
        reasons of concious consumption. The liberal analysis positions
        the consumer as the rationalist, practicing consumption with
        calculation and always towards the self. Marxist theory, on the
        other hand, sees the consumer as the victim of the market,
        unable to make own decisions.</p>
        <p>Both viewpoints incapacitate the consumer.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“In neither liberal nor Marxist theories are consumers
        understood to be responsible agents, accountable to the world
        beyond their personal concerns.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In alternative hedonism the consumer is seen from their own
        point of view, as a responsible being that makes informed
        decisions and having the outside (environement, justice) and the
        inside (pleasure, self-actualisation) in mind. That also means,
        that consumption must be analysis from the personal towards the
        public - a bottom up approach.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“[The] focus is neither on consumption as a bid for personal
        distinction, nor on consumption as a relatively unconscious”form
        of life,” but instead on the ways in which a range of
        contemporary consumerist practices, more or less everyday and
        identityoriented, are being brought into question because of
        their environmental consequences, their impact on health, and
        their constraints on sensual enjoyment and more spiritual forms
        of well-being.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Kate Soper goes into the details, in how top-down approaches
        (state regulations and ethics) can support alternative hedonism
        in it’s development. The political aspect is probably better
        outlined in the book, from which this text is just a
        chapter.</p>
        <p>The thoughts outline this text are rich in inspiration,
        adding to the vocabulary of economic analysis and opening up new
        path to go forward. Consumption, like technological development,
        will go forward. Neither liberal nor marxist analysis take the
        human in it’s entire reality, but often work with abstract
        entities. Using the actual person as a starting point is very
        close to design reasearch and ethnography.</p>
