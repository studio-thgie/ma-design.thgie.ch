        Workshop</h1>

        Workshop I</a></p>
        <h2 id="notes-on-workshop-format">Notes on workshop format</h2>
        <p>The pace of the workshop was welcomed by the participants. In
        contrast to classical design thinking workshops, this format
        here was much slower and introspective. I had two currents going
        on. On was to bring the participants, who didn’t know each
        other, together. The other current was to open up the
        imagination from a common starting point.</p>
        <p>The workshop culminated in a shared storytelling session. Not
        as planned, the participants prefered to work alone on their
        stories. The participants also wished to know more about or work
        more with the subject of animism, which was a bit lesser
        represented in this workshop.</p>
        <p>The main goal of the workshop, to have a workable idea for a
        prototype, was missed. That said, the stories are rich in
        references, that in combination with the emotionally durable
        design framework can give rise to a prototype. I think I will
        work something out and make a proposition of a prototype to the
        participants that they can give a feedback on then.</p>
        <h2
        id="examination-thoughts-and-key-points-on-the-stories">Examination,
        thoughts and key points on the stories</h2>
        <p>I also include fragments of what was said during the more
        informal talks in this reflection.</p>
        <p>Form (as in design) was not an issue, thought or talked
        about. That was surprising to me. Form was mentioned in the way
        of it’s function, for example it’s implementation and function
        in the environment (doors) or as jewelery. That said,
        physicality or bodily closeness mattered a lot to the
        participants. Touch and wearing or even VAs thought of as
        prosthesis (as in enabling something one can’t do on their own)
        was often mentioned.</p>
        <p>A big topic was the proper recognition of a VA, a honest
        other-than-humaning. The participants had the feeling that the
        fake human persona leads only to problems; master slave
        patterns, frustration through weird communication, unnecessary
        emotional investements. The VAs need to be positioned and act as
        a other-than-human that they actually are. The participants
        didn’t want to have to love the device, or being overly
        dependent on it.</p>
        <p>This motion of de-anthropomorphising the VAs was paralelled
        by the desire to meet them at eye level (auf Augenhöhe
        begegnen). That mainly meant that there is a mutuality or
        reciprocity in gestures. For example to have to care for the
        device in order for it to provide its services.</p>
        <p>Another big issue was trust, in the device but mainly in the
        companies behind the device. It’s permanent presence is not
        necessarily wished for (as in being in control of your
        safety/comfort zones) which is very important in the context of
        a home. In the futuring process, ideas were talked about, how a
        world with ubiqutous VAs would look and feel like. In that
        context, laws and regulations but also societal behaviour are
        important parts to think about.</p>
        <p>Not having any input on the form (aesthetics) of an animist
        approach to VAs leaves me with a big gap here. The question
        arises if this aspect is left to cultural interpretation or if
        the participants were not enabled to imagine in this
        direction.</p>
