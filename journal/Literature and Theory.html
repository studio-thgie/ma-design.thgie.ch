        <p>May 24, 2020</p>
        <p>As always, I had quite a wild ride when going into literature
        and theory. Here is a brief overview of the fields I went into.
        It was mainly through scientific papers and articles in journals
        or on established web-plattforms.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Thing Theory</li>
        <li>New Materialism</li>
        <li>Posthumanism</li>
        <li>Speculative Design</li>
        <li>Animism in Design</li>
        <li>Anthropological discourses about animism</li>
        <li>Research on smartphones</li>
        <li>Discourses about repair, brokenness, maintenance</li>
        <li>Philosophical dicourses on ontology</li>
        <li>Research into Shintoism</li>
        <li>Actor-network-theory</li>
        <li>Anthropology of capitalist relations</li>
        <li>Decolonizing design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reading is always my big problem. I like it to much. That is
        also a reason, why I want to do the <em>reading theory</em>
        course at the Y Institute next semester. I need to improve my
        reading workflow to be more selective and make better use of
        what I’m reading.</p>
        <p>This and the last semster I tried to find a language that I
        could use to express what the project is about. It is crucial to
        know which concepts one is referencing and why. Especially since
        I’m working with a, at least for us, foreign concept, an act of
        translation is important. I think I managed for now, but I
        believe that I can refine it in the coming month.</p>
        <p>I was most fascinated by one paper in particular, in which
        they researched the effects of the witnessing of the repair of a
        smartphone on the client. The way it was written, the simple and
        effective setup, the discussion of results was perfect. I’d like
        to aspire to that paper.</p>
        <p>All over all, after all this reading, I believe it’s safe to
        say, that there are strands or a background-noise of animism in
        western culture, but we don’t know how to express it. That is a
        hypothesis for now. I also found some grounds onto which I can
        put the importance of my approach especially Anna-Marie Willis
        notion of ontological design (<span class="citation"
        data-cites="willisOntologicalDesigning2006">@willisOntologicalDesigning2006</span>).</p>
