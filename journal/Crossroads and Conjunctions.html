        Conjunctions</h1>
        <p><em>Feb 27, 2021</em></p>
        <p>I reached kind of a crossroad in my project, but it’s a messy
        one. It’s not just that one path intersects with the one I was
        on. The path I’m on has no straight continuation from this point
        onwards.</p>
        <h2 id="review-of-the-process-so-far">Review of the process so
        far</h2>
        <p>I set out to find insights into the <a
        href="research/Intentions,%20Questions%20and%20Hypothesis.html">Intentions,
        Questions and Hypothesis</a> that gave raise to this research
        endeavour. To do this, I crafted a <a
        href="journal/Researchplan%202020.html">Researchplan 2020</a> that
        I followed up to this point:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>gather insights into the interaction between users and voice
        assistants, as well as the involved emotions and values, through
        ethnographic methodology in the field</li>
        <li>analyse the collected material through thematic analysis to
        find weak signals and general understandings of the current
        situation</li>
        <li>work through material together with experts to come up with
        propositions for prototypes that rethink our interaction with
        voice assistants from an animism perspective</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So far, this has worked out very much to my pleasing. The
        results were surprising at times and predictable at others.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>there is no real use case for voice assistants as an
        interface and would only make sense for a small percentage of
        users; mainly people with visual or mobility impairments, like
        elderly people</li>
        <li>there is a unifying current of frustration amongst all
        user-personas stemming from the expectations the users have and
        what is delivered by the assistant</li>
        <li>we already live in a highly animistic world; we just don’t
        have a vocabulary for it and the spirits we bring into our homes
        are much more like minor poltergeister then helpful kobolds (at
        times a bit like Pumuckl’s evil twin on crack)</li>
        <li>an alternative and also very plausible interpretation is,
        that people really don’t want an animistic techno-sphere and
        prefer the master-slave paradigme in HCI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last step done so far, the <a
        href="research/designs/Expert%20Workshop%20I.html">Expert Workshop
        I</a>, was very productive. I got a lot of material to think and
        work through, but I’m missing one crucial aspect. The missing of
        this aspect initiated this round of reflection. One aspect that
        we didn’t think or speak about, was form. Form as in gestalt,
        colors, materials, etc. We work a lot on interaction and
        persona, but for my approach that is not enough.</p>
        <h2 id="problems-and-outlook">Problems and outlook</h2>
        <p>Honestly I didn’t think much about the testing, as I was
        hopeing that this would follow organically after I know how the
        prototype will be like. But the prototype is also depending on
        the way of testing. Will I just change on parameter, like
        material? Or the whole thing, inclusive packaging and
        interaction rituals and voice of the assistant and and and? In
        hindsight it could be said, that not defining what this
        prototype could be like was a risky decision. But for me it was
        more important to leave this kind of <em>creative freedom</em>
        to the experts. Also, and very crucially, I can’t interfer with
        one of the biggest aspects of a voice assistant and that is the
        software part. I could, but I would have to go down a different
        route and it would take a lot of time.</p>
        <p>I was able to present my problematic at the last project club
        and essentially three answers were formulated:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>more form/material analysis is needed, for example in the
        form of product semantics and close readings of the
        assistants</li>
        <li>dig deeper into the psycological aspects, for example
        through Habermas’ Geliebte Dinge and theories of perception
        etc</li>
        <li>I need another round of ideation where I try to give form
        through speculative methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I feel comfortable with all three approachs and/or a mix of
        it. But I’m very sure that I need to reschedule my timeline
        somewhat. I was thinking that I could produce kind of a
        <em>real</em> prototype in March and have it tested until the
        colloquium 2 by different participants, in a cultural probe
        style. But right now I think I will take more time to develop
        these prototypes, visualize them, give form to the interactive
        parts in mockup films, doing practical experiments with
        materials etc and then discuss these with the experts again.</p>
        <p>The proposed timeline would look something along the way
        of</p>
        <ul>
        <li>form analysis and speculative design from March until
        April</li>
        <li>discussion with experts and writeup of results in May</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore I want or even need to expand the scope of the
        project to animistic human-computer interfaces with a focus on
        voice user interfaces, for reasons I think I need to reflect on
        in another posts (or add on here later).</p>
