        2021</h1>
        <p>The conference was held online, due to pandemic
        circumstances. That means it had more or less the same problem
        like <a href="journal/Reclaim%20Futures%202020.html">Reclaim
        Futures 2020</a>. The organisation was great, there were quite a
        lot of spectators, but interaction inbetween participants was
        reduced to a minimum.</p>

        New Experimental Research on Design 2021</a></p>
        <p>I have to admit that the Q&amp;A session after my
        presentation was really good. The questions got more or less
        just asked by the board members, and it seems like that they
        were quite keen to get into some details or had this or that
        recommendation.</p>
        <p>For the first time in my life (!) I didnâ€™t write the whole
        text in advance and then read it during the presentation. This
        time I just had an outline along which I made a slide-show.
        Both, and my application for the conference, can be access
        below. I reused parts of the presentation for my second
        colloquium.</p>
