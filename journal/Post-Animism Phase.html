        <p>Mar 05, 2021</p>
        <p>I had a very good coaching this week. Not an easy one, but a
        good one. As pointed out in the last post, <a
        href="journal/Crossroads%20and%20Conjunctions.html">Crossroads and
        Conjunctions</a>, I’m somewhat at a place where I can go
        straight forward. My mentor booked this under being lost, which
        captures it quite nicely.</p>
        <p>The problem I’m facing is, that despite all the wonderful
        material at hand, I’m not able to translate an animistic
        framework into reality without falling back into appropriating
        other cultures or being purely speculative. The first option is
        without question a big no go. I don’t mind the second, but as my
        mentor also pointed out, it would need me to go into a direction
        I’m not necessarily comfortable with.</p>
        <p>Taking the second option would essentially mean, that I
        remove myself from an applied reality, and that’s definitly not
        why I wanted to do this project. It seems to me, it would also
        be a waste of my potential as having a firm foot in applied
        technology with a long standing experience. As a software
        developer i’m more of a craftsperson. Building pragmatic things,
        but with ideology, ethics and poesie.</p>
        <p>The research so far invested in animism in and with design
        isn’t wasted. But if I can’t translate it into reality within
        the frame of product design, I need to take it out of the
        equation and use it as a tools that informs my research and my
        approach, but not the <em>product</em>. Animism, especially
        after Betti Marenko, is a great posthuman framework to analyse
        and critique design approaches, especially the human-centered
        paradigma. And it is especially valuable in the world of digital
        and electronic everyday technologies.</p>
        <p>How to go on from here… If the question isn’t anymore how
        animism can inform design, what will I do?.</p>
