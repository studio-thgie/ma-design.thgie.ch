        <p>Zaman, B., Van Mechelen, M., &amp; Bleumers, L. (2018). When
        toys come to life: Considering the internet of toys from an
        animistic design perspective. Proceedings of the 17th ACM
        Conference on Interaction Design and Children, 170–180.

        </blockquote>
        <p>This paper does a traditional as well as an animistic
        analysis of three different toy prototypes. Especially the
        thematic analyis as well as it’s basis on the Betti Marenko’s
        paper on neo-animism in design is of interest.</p>
        <p>The research presented in the paper leaves missing any notion
        of things having soul, spririt, conciousness, etc. The analysis
        works solely with the notion of agency. This is no necessarily
        the notion of animism I want to work with, but the analysis
        presented is very interested. Agency is in line with perceiving
        something as animated, physically or epistemologically.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The meaning of the Bracelet is incomplete when children do
        not co-construct its significance, which signifies the embodied
        nature of animistic design and echoes [23:228] statement that
        agency in animistic designs is not something that objects have,
        but only exists in relation to its user(s) or in its encounters
        with other things and data.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I’m not quite sure, if I would agree with this statement,
        following <em>Vibrant Matter</em><a href="/journal/When toys come to life.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, but it’s certainly valid
        from a interaction design perspective. Things can have agency
        without our doing, but we can perceive them as such much better
        if we’re integrated in the interaction.</p>
        <p>Especially four concepts were of importance in the animistic
        analysis:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>agency</li>
        <li>embodiement</li>
        <li>ecology</li>
        <li>uncertainity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following Betti Marenko on neo-animism, these are the core
        factors of animistic design. While agency, embodiement and
        ecology are more common in the posthuman discourses,
        uncertainity is not. She worked on this in the research project
        <em>Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction
        between the human and the nonhuman</em><a href="/journal/When toys come to life.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Uncertainity is opposed by
        the more tradition UX pattern of command-response, and is deemed
        a core quality of animisitic design. The interaction is not
        predefined, but overshadow by uncertainity. The answer is not
        necessarily being predictable.</p>
        <p>Reading this paper, not finding any animistic weak signals in
        the interaction with the voice assistants is understandable.</p>
