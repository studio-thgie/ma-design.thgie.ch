        <p>Sep 26, 2020</p>
        <p>I was given the chance to present my project and core-topic
        at a wonderful conference. The conference was planned to happen
        in summer in Lausanne, Switzerland. Covid happened and the
        conference moved to autumn and online. I think it was a smart
        move and the attendance and talks were amazing as well as
        inspiring.</p>
        <p>The talk was pre-recorded and I took the chance to produce a
        small experimental film, in which I show the practice of
        entangling with everyday objects.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>“Animism had endowed things with souls; industrialism makes
        souls into things.” - Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The talk circles around notions of care for the non-human and
        more specifically for the technologies that we surround
        ourselves with. Anne-Marie Willis’ ontological design describes
        how we not only design objects, but also how these objects
        design our ontologies. Consumer electronics and algorithms
        became steady companions in our life. Not only do we interact
        with them on a regular base, they also accompany us throughout
        the day. We could call them companion technologies, following
        Donna Haraway’s concept of companion species — digital
        technologies and people, who are bonded in significant
        otherness.</p>
        <p>These technological products and processes are highly
        designed and branded experiences, to be consumed and discarded.
        They gift us a membership of specific cultural demographics.
        They’re not made to last, unlike you would expect from a good
        pair of shoes. Their frictionless design makes them easily
        replaceable, which also expresses itself in the sheer
        unrepairability. Following these lines of thought, design
        practices disable not only the care for the thing, but also our
        understanding of the importance to care for our immediate
        environment.</p>
        <p>Consumer electronics become mediators of ontological
        affordances.</p>
        <p>Alternative ways of caring for companion technologies are
        found in animistic practice. Animistic epistemologies enable us
        to level the ontological field and create social ties to things.
        These epistemologies then enable different ways for caring and
        respectful relations to the non-human. In the light of the
        environmental impact of todays technologies, cared for and
        long-living companion things seem to be a desirable
        alternative.</p>
        <p>How then can we imagine our relationship to technological
        products and processes otherwise? How can we imagine their
        ontological status and our entanglement with them anew?</p>
