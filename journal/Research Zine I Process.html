        <p>Feb 05, 2021</p>
        <p>The last few days I also invested in creating material for
        the workshop with the experts (designers and crafts-people). My
        intention is to present them workable material without having to
        access a screen. Thus the <a
        href="output/Research%20Zine%20I%20-%20March%202021.html">Research
        Zine I - March 2021</a>. In my experience you quickly lose
        people once they have to work with digital material. It’s just a
        different mode that needs a different mental state and few can
        switch quickly between these. We also have quite a lot of
        screen-time lately, don’t we?</p>
        <p>This little workable zine is meant to spur the mind. In a
        moment of the workshop, I will leave the participants alone with
        it. They can take the time to dive in and pick up what they
        might find interesting. With an inspired mind and intuition, we
        will come back together to discuss what came up. More details
        about this process are found here: <a
        href="research/designs/Expert%20Workshop%20I.html">Expert Workshop
        I</a>.</p>
        <p>The zine contains some fundamentals about animism and the
        specific approach in this research project. It will then further
        concentrate on the findings, especially the <a
        href="output/Thematic%20Analysis.html">Thematic Analysis</a> as
        well as the different visual I gathered. The content is then
        accompagnied by quotes and fragments picked out of the research
        data as well as questions that I had and have.</p>
