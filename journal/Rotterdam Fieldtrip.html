        <h1 id="rotterdam-fieldtrip">Rotterdam Fieldtrip</h1>
        <p>Feb 09, 2020</p>
        <p>Travelled from Bern to Rotterdam with train today, while the
        Ciara/Sabrina storm came from the other side. Somehow the 8h in
        the train went over so quickly. I hardly did anything. But it’s
        a good state to be in. The train and my mind. Had one important
        intellectual moment, reading about the extended self and
        companion objects.</p>
        <p>Changing for the last train in Utrecht, but the storm was
        quicker and fucked up some traintracks to Rotterdam. Had to find
        an additional route via Den Haag. Was packed but I was in good
        company. Essentially 12h on road, and still, not much effort
        needed to come up here.</p>
        <h2 id="feb-10-2020---commence">Feb 10, 2020 - Commence</h2>
        <p>Started with coffee, toast and a cat. Night was windy and
        chilly. Slept not too good.</p>
        <p>We walked quite a lot through the windy and cold city. We had
        a look at the PZI, the Piet Zwart Institute and got and
        introduction to the XPUB masters degree which I personally like
        aaa lot. It’s about experimental publishing practices - but
        coming from software and network studies. I definitly have to
        look into this, also as a possible exchange semester.</p>
        <p>After that we had a guided tour with a focus on urban
        development in on part of the city, another talk about a social
        housing project and another talk on the history of urban
        development of Rotterdam.</p>
        <h2 id="feb-11-2020---2nd-day-walking-mushrooms-and-pzi">Feb 11,
        2020 - 2nd day, Walking, Mushrooms and PZI</h2>
        <p>Mushrooms got cancelled, which is a pitty. We went on the
        walking tour through the port area with a first stop on a
        floating farm. The project is quite amazing, but still a dairy
        farm. There is this question on the needs of the sustainability
        and circularity of a dairy farm, when dairy is not the most
        important product. Still an amazing project.</p>
        <p>The port area was wonderful. Lots of empty space taken over
        by artists and social project. Weather was an asshole.</p>
        <p>In the evening we had an exchange with the PZI MA in design.
        They explained us their master and we explained them ours. After
        that we had a workshop, part speed dating, part us taking on the
        role of an expert. We got asked to help them reflect on their
        project and the next steps. Which was a bit weird, because I
        asked myself, if I’m actually allowed to take on that role while
        still being a student myself. Was a good way to reflect on my
        own project tho.</p>
        <h2 id="feb-12-2020---pzi-alumna-bluecity-and-more-walking">Feb
        12, 2020 - PZI Alumna, BlueCity and more walking</h2>
        <p>The morning started with a session with a former student of
        the MA Design at PZI. She now works as a design researcher in
        the government. Which is interessting in so far as she is inside
        policy making/reviewing prcesses now. She told us about her
        methods, which are more playful and grafical (ie putting cubes
        on a mapping to cast votes) and e reflected a bit on the
        keyterms <em>design-thinking</em> and
        <em>human-centerdness</em>.</p>
        <p>We then visited BlueCity, a former aquaparc, now a circular
        economy hub. They work after the blue economy, which thinks in
        abundance. I might look at that.</p>
        <pre><code>The term “Blue Economy” was first used by Gunter Pauli to describe his business model to shift society from scarcity to abundance “with what is locally available“</code></pre>
        <p>The place was realy nice and very active. There was a spirit
        of entrepreneurship with love about it. They overed us a
        lemonade made from a christmas tree in the beginning, which I
        absolutely loved.</p>
        <p>Water taxi intermission!</p>
        <p>Then another walking tour in Rotterdam Zuid, which was super
        interessting but also super long. <em>“At least, it didn’t
        rain.”</em></p>
        <h2 id="feb-13-2020---almost-friday-the-13th">Feb 13, 2020 -
        Almost Friday (the 13th)</h2>
        <p>We had a day of workshop at the A/BZ Studio. They are
        entangled with the PZI and also give courses there. We had a
        workshop, where the PZI students had to test out prototypes of
        their projects and we’re again in the position of experts or
        outsiders.</p>
        <p>Despite not being able to work directly on my own project, it
        helped a lot with reflection and how to prototype a method, test
        it out and reflect on it. The process here seems to lean a bit
        more on the doing side.</p>
