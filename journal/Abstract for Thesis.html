        <p>I tried to collect all my thoughts into an abstract in
        preparation for the thesis. It’s to long but parts of it will
        flow into other areas.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This research proposal is about exploring the potential of
        voice assistant technologies for the blind as well people with
        visual impairments, the extent to which this technologies can
        provide and assist access to the world, and how their design
        could be improved to serve the specific needs of the target
        demographic.</p>
        <p>Voice assistants, like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Echo devices,
        have established themselves over the last ten years within
        applications of entertainment and home automation. They are
        designed with a general public in mind, a one kind serves all
        approach. Despite not being designed specific as assistive
        technologies, people with visual impairments nonetheless adopt
        voice assistants at a steady growing pace. Voice assistants
        point to a depart from more traditional assistive technologies
        for people with visual impairments, like screen readers or voice
        recognition software. A circumstance which is also mirrored in
        the specific development environments of the main competitors in
        the voice assistant market. Amazon, Microsoft and others do have
        disability labs but their research results find little space in
        the final products.</p>
        <p>As a rather young and complex technology, voice assistants
        enjoy being intensely studied right now. Particular attention
        has so far been paid to the algorithms and artificial
        intelligences underlying the technology and their biases
        (Bajorek, 2019; Danielescu, 2020), persona design (Danielescu,
        2020; Humphry &amp; Chesher, 2020), issues around privacy
        (Easwara Moorthy &amp; Vu, 2014; Pal et al., 2020), the
        post-phenomenology of such assistants (Hector &amp; Hrncal,
        2020; Wiltse, 2020) and, on a smaller scale, voice assistants as
        assistive devices for people with impairments (Masina et al.,
        2020; Pradhan et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>In the studies cited, voice assistants are primarily
        approached from a technical, social or legal perspective. Within
        the give case of voice assistants being adopted as assistive
        devices, additional problems arise from the perspective of
        ontological design. Contrary to applications in the
        entertainment sector, voice assistants as assistive technologies
        become existential technologies and fundamentally change they
        way people with visual impairments have access to the world. A
        circumstance that can be observed in such mundane practices as
        online shopping.</p>
        <p>It is thus crucial to ask: What makes contemporary voice
        assistants attractive to people with visual impairments? How can
        we ensure, that these technologies are up to the task of being
        of existential importance? What can we learn from the design of
        traditional but comparative assistive technologies, like screen
        readers and voice recognition software?</p>
        <p>The proposed research project is setup as a comparative study
        that extends into a prototyping phase. The general approach is
        human-centered design with a heavy leaning on ontological
        design, which is to say that in terms of data collection the
        respective lifeworlds of the participants, the social situation
        and actants of a given environment are integrated (opposed to a
        focus on functionality, with research done in labs). In a first
        round, ethnographic methods are applied to study and compare
        traditional assistive technologies for people with visual
        impairments versus voice assistants for the same set of tasks,
        like information retrieval, online shopping and interaction with
        computational systems.</p>
        <p>The data collected serves as a baseline for workshops on
        prototyping interaction as well as situations. The underlying
        framework for this phase is based on an universal design
        approach, which “is the design and composition of an environment
        so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest
        extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size,
        ability or disability”<a href="/journal/Abstract for Thesis.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The prototypes
        will explore directions in the design of voice assistants as
        assistive devices by applying learnings from traditional
        assistive technologies. The workshops are also exploring
        problems that arise from the unmitigated application of voice
        assistants as assistive technologies in order to analyze the
        inherent risks in such practices.</p>
        <p>The findings will be disseminated in lectures, peer-reviewed
        journals, workshops as well as an open-source published guide
        for designing voice assistants for people with visual
        impairments. The guide is produced for interested parties,
        especially for designers, developers and people or institutions
        that are actively working with the blind or people with visual
        impairments. Next to the research results, the guide will
        include tutorials and technological fragments, like code
        examples and device blueprints and as such, can be built upon in
        practice as well as in further research projects.</p>
