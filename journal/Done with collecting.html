        <p>Jan 28, 2021</p>
        <p>Yesterday I officially finished the ethnographic research
        phase. I conducted interviews, I did participatory observation
        and I roamed the internet for data.</p>
        <p>The interviews were meant to get basic insights into what
        kind of place these voice assistant devices have in their owners
        life. I wanted to oppose that by direct observation of how the
        participants interact with the devices. Organising the
        observations was no easy feat. None of the people I asked, who
        already have one or more devices at home, felt at ease with me
        being there and watching them. I found this disparation funny.
        Usually, the people cited privacy concerns, which I fully
        understand and respect.</p>
        <p>The problem arises out of the paradox of having these devices
        in your most sacred spots. Voice assistants are known to have
        huge privacy issues. If a command is not recognized, often the
        recording is sent to a human to double check what exactly went
        wrong. And quite often the device also listens without our
        intent for it to do so. So on the one hand, the people have
        problems with me being there and observing them, but don’t mind
        (or simply ignore) that the device does that all the time.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the ethnographic phase I had to realise,
        that one of my assumptions didn’t turn out. I assumed, or hoped,
        to find animistic weak signals in the interaction between users
        and devices. But that hardly is the case. It’s not terrible, but
        I would have loved to find at least a bit of that. Depending on
        the framing of animism, especially after Betti Marenko’s <a
        href="texts/Neo-Animism%20and%20Design.html">Neo-Animism and
        Design</a>, there are things to be found around the theme of
        uncertainity.</p>
        <p>I didn’t quite get enough data from interviews and
        observation but I could add a few other data points to the mix.
        I added experience reports from the internet in which people
        describe their experiences with the devices. Furthermore I found
        it interesting, how the devices are visualized or narrated in
        advertisement images and videos. It is a good comparison, to how
        the devices are actually used in real life. Last but not least,
        I also researched how the devices are customized, through hacks
        and skins one can buy online.</p>
        <p>I’m looking forward to the reflexive thematic analysis, to
        see what kind of codes and themes can be developed out of the
        collected data.</p>
