# Findings and Output
The thematic analysis was a very important corner stone during the research. It concluded the ethnographic phase and produced valuable insights into what relationships we have with voice assistants.

These are intermitten presentations that I could produce out of the research material and thoughts that went into the projects, but are not related to the structure of the MA Design.

## Colloquia
These are the three MA Design Colloquium papers and presentation which show the changes throughout the two and a half years I worked on this project.

## Texts and Essay
These are texts that came into existence during my MA studies but are not directly related to the research focus. I included them here because they are important to my personal basic stance on how I conduct research.

- [Negotiating Privacy with Voice Assistants](output/Negotiating%20Privacy%20with%20Voice%20Assistants.md)
- [Animistic Emotionally Durable Design](output/dissemination/Animistic%20Emotionally%20Durable%20Design.md)
- [Trees](journal/Trees.md)

The following texts were written very early in the project, where the focus was still on an ecological consideration of electronics. It is completely possible that some of it emerged out of class workshops.

- [Agency within the  context of new materialism](output/Agency%20within%20the%20%20context%20of%20new%20materialism.md)
- [Design and New Materialism - Possible approaches](output/Design%20and%20New%20Materialism%20-%20Possible%20approaches.md)
- [On the Application of Animism in Design](output/On%20the%20Application%20of%20Animism%20in%20Design.md)
- [Object relations](output/Object%20relations.md)
- [From Hari-Kuy≈ç to Airpods](output/From%20Hari-Kuy%C5%8D%20to%20Airpods.md)
