## Observation
09:15 Participant says, "I'm quite unsure where to put the device. It's quite comfortable to use it handsfree but often it's in another room, so it doesn't hear me very well. I almost would love to have a device in every room!"

09:45 Participant begins work routine, device is in other room. doing administrative tasks.

09:54 Participant talks with the parrots, while they roam around the room in search for a little distraction

10:28 Participant takes care of the parrots in the aviary, gets back to work and plays the news via the voice assistant. She controls the output from the phone, without a voice command, but via interface. ([interaction through app](output/codes/interaction%20through%20app.md))

10:32 The parrots are complaining in the adjunct room about the news playing. Participant lowers the volume of the speaker through the smartphone interface. ([nonhumans interact with the assistant](output/codes/nonhumans%20interact%20with%20the%20assistant.md))

10:47 Participant was on toilett. The radio-news stopped playing meanwhile. The parrots continued to make noise. Participant calms the parrot by providing some shades then continues to to issue the command "Hey Google, spiel I got you babe von Sonny and Chair". The speaker plays the music.

11:07 Before a smoke break, Participant turns off the music and issues the command "and Hey Google, play bird sounds".

11:27 Participant tries to find her smartphone and issues some different commands to the speaker. She first tries to call herself then asks "where is my phone", but uses a slangword for phone that the assistant doesn't understand. ([failed interaction](output/codes/failed%20interaction.md))
