There were several accounts of miscommunication happning in the second half of december.

Several instances of miscommunication

- Sometimes, the assistant changes speaking or response patterns. ([expecting different reaction](output/codes/expecting%20different%20reaction.md), [changes in assistant responses](output/codes/changes%20in%20assistant%20responses.md))
- The devices misunderstands quite a lot of commands, often ending up playing something unexpected on Spotify. ([assistant misunderstands](output/codes/assistant%20misunderstands.md), [expecting different reaction](output/codes/expecting%20different%20reaction.md), [negative serendipity](negative%20serendipity), [discovering unexpected music](output/codes/discovering%20unexpected%20music.md))
- The participant sometimes uses the device to add items to a shopping list. It works quite well on English, but on french the device is often confused. It then asks to create new shopping lists or adds weird items to the list. ([problems with language](output/codes/problems%20with%20language.md))
- When announcing the songs from Spotify, the titles are sometimes hilarious, because title, artist and album (or something like that) name are used which results in something like "I'm playing Noël Noël Noël Christmas Happy Noël". ([hilarious moment](output/codes/hilarious%20moment.md))
