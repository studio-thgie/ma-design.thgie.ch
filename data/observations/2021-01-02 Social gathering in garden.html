        <p><em>2020-12-24</em></p>
        <p>It was early evening, the sun was setting in and there was a
        small social gathering for the reason of cheering for the
        birthday of the participant. There was a firebowl with a nice
        fire and the participants prepared some snacks, as well as
        mulled wine.</p>
        <p>The participant took the device outside to play music.</p>

        <img src="/assets/images/IMG_20210102_165639.jpg"

        aria-hidden="true">IMG_20210102_165639.jpg</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Other people at the small gather also started to choose
        songs. But often, they didnâ€™t quite trust that they will be
        heard. They went closer to the device, to make sure their
        commands work. Sometimes the device also played something wrong,
        which was received with amusement by the group.</p>
        <p>Some tales of voice assistants were exchanged. Like the one
        instance, where a user talked in English with the device, but in
        a german accent, and the device answered in German.</p>
