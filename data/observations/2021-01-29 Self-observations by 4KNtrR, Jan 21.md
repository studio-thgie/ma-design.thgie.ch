- For the longest time, the participant issued a command wrong. When wanting to know the time, he asked "Hey Google, how late is it?". To which the assistant responded "Yes, you are". Which was more then confusing. The device seemed to understand, that the participants wishes to know if he is late. The question doesn't make much sense, but even more so, that there is a jokingly response to it by the assistant. ([[joking with, through or about assistant]], [[knowing the time]])
- Already two times this month, the voice assistant got triggered by something that sounded or was said during dinner. We just her the assistant go off, that it didn't understand something. At the moment we got frightened for a moment, since we didn't issue any command and didn't expect the assistant to speak. ([[assistant is creepy]], [[uncertain behavour]])
