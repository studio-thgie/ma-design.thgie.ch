## Observations
Upon arrivale at the participants home, I can observe the following situation. The partner of the participants discusses over some plan or images, together with what I assume to be the mother of either of them. The partner then issues the commando "Alexa, wir wollen Fernseh schauen" / "Alexa, we want to watch television". The scene prepares several rooms and adjusts the light, turns off some, dimms others. ([issued commando](output/codes/issued%20commando.md), [scenes and routines](output/codes/scenes%20and%20routines.md))

They actually were not watching television, but the partner memorized this commando as a desireable mood for the light-settings. ([conditioning the behaviour of user](output/codes/conditioning%20the%20behaviour%20of%20user.md), [adusting behavior to accomodate assistants possibilities](output/codes/adusting%20behavior%20to%20accomodate%20assistants%20possibilities.md), [scenes and routines](output/codes/scenes%20and%20routines.md), [misusing assistant](misusing%20assistant))
