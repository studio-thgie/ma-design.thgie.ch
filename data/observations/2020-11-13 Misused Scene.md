# Misused Scene

At: [[Person eQXH0W]]

## Observations
Upon arrivale at the participants home, I can observe the following situation. The partner of the participants discusses over some plan or images, together with what I assume to be the mother of either of them. The partner then issues the commando "Alexa, wir wollen Fernseh schauen" / "Alexa, we want to watch television". The scene prepares several rooms and adjusts the light, turns off some, dimms others. ([[issued commando]], [[scenes and routines]])

They actually were not watching television, but the partner memorized this commando as a desireable mood for the light-settings. ([[conditioning the behaviour of user]], [[adusting behavior to accomodate assistants possibilities]], [[scenes and routines]], [[misusing assistant]])
