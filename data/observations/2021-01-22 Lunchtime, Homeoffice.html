        <hr />
        <h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Living room, large black table, the sun is shining and the
        room is bightly lit with contrastful shadows</li>
        <li>VA is placed in kitchen, which is only separated through a
        narrow hallway. the va could be potentially actived since the
        door of the living room is oposite the door of the kitchen</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="observation">Observation</h2>
        <p>11:00 p excuses herself, saying that she doesn’t need the
        device very much and she is unsure if she is skilled enough to
        really use it. I explain the nature of participatory observation
        and that she doesn’t need to use it on purpose. She mentions
        that she usually uses the device for cooking, or sometimes to
        listen to music. <a
        href="output/codes/feeling%20insecure.html">feeling
        insecure</a></p>
        <p>11:20 p sitting in living room, focuses on work she has to to
        for her studies</p>
        <p>11:42 p “Dann geh ich mal kochen und lass dich hier. Jetzt
        kommt dann die grossartige Show.” Until this moment, we were
        working together at the table in the living room</p>
        <p>11:43 p “Hast du einen Liederwunsch?” I work</p>
        <p>11:43 p “Ok Google, LA Salami spielen” The Answer from the
        device is not understandable, since I sit in the other room. It
        seems to make the participant uncomfortable, she laughs it off.
        The device seems to have misunderstood <em>salami</em>. “Ok
        Google, Musik von LA Salami spielen.” This time the device
        reacts correctly but weirdly spells “LA” in German, not nowing
        it’s part of a name. (<a
        href="output/codes/assistant%20misunderstands.html">assistant
        misunderstands</a>)</p>
        <p>11:45 p starts to cook, peeling onions while some easy
        listening is playing.</p>
        <p>11:46 I decide to stay in the living room to prevent the
        participant from becoming uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>11:57 “Ok Google, nächstes Lied”</p>
        <p>12:05 Sister of p arrives.</p>
        <p>12:09 There was some chaos in the kitchen because a pot
        overspilled. I moved to the kitchen to see if I can help.</p>
        <p>12:12 “Ok Google, Timer auf 8 Minuten stellen” (<a
        href="output/codes/setting%20a%20timer.html">setting a
        timer</a>)</p>
        <p>12:20 Timer on device goes of. Participant tries to touch it,
        to turn the timer of, but it unsuccesful. A second approach
        works. (<a href="output/codes/failed%20interaction.html">failed
        interaction</a>)</p>
        <p>12:21 I tell my newest finding, that when the timer goes of,
        the device also starts to listen and you can just say stop,
        instead of “Ok Google, stop”.</p>
        <p>12:22 p tells me an aneqdote. She tried the crystall ball
        service, where you can ask questions and the device “divines”
        answers. She ask how many children she will get, and the device
        just answered with “No”. (<a

        of a service</a>, <a

        <p>12:24 The device is still playing “LA Salami” (<a
        href="output/codes/background%20music.html">background
        music</a>)</p>
        <p>12:59 We ate until now, the device was not used anymore so
        far.</p>
        <p>13:05 A discussion about the functions and settings of the
        device starts off. The partner of the participant sealed of the
        “Home” of the participant so that the sister can’t log into
        their system and vice versa. After mentioning some of the main
        usages of the device, the sister mentions that the participants
        seems to use the device much more then herself. The participant
        told me about what she needs the device for, mainly. (<a

        <ul>
        <li>Disney Quiz</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
        <li>Recalculate recipes</li>
        <li>Volume control</li>
        <li>Traffic information</li>
        <li>Timer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>She also tells me, that adding stuff to her shopping list
        doesn’t work well.</p>
        <p>14:00 No more usage of the device until now. The participant
        went about to help her sister to construct a shelf.</p>
