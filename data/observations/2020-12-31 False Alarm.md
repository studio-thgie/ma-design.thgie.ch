*2020-12-31*

[Person bKEfGP](data/people/Person%20bKEfGP.md)

The participant wanted to set a timer and used the keyword *alarm* instead of *timer*. Instead of setting a timer for 1 hour, the participant set an alarm for 1:00 in the night. When the alarm set of, the participant woke up and was scared, since the alarm wasn't easily recogniseable nor locateable for a few seconds. Also remembering, that friends recently had a breakin in their house.
