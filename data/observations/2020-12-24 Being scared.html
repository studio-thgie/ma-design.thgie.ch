        <p>Participant was outside in the garden when the parrots
        started to scream a lot. Wondering what was happening she
        reentered the home. The voice assistant was playing Maria
        Carries <em>All I Want for Christmas</em> with maximum volume.
        The participant tried to lower the volume via Google Home app,
        but the volume kept on rising again. Nobody else was around, who
        could play a prank. At this point the participant became really
        scared. (<a

        <p>It turned out, that her sister, who lives upstairs was trying
        out the Google Home app and connected to the participants
        device. Because she could not hear the song playing she upped
        the volume.</p>
