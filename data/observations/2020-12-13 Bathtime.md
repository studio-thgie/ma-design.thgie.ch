## Observations
- Participant is next to device and issues the command "Hey Google, raise the volume." As the device has buttons for that, it would have been more efficient to use those. ([issued commando](output/codes/issued%20commando.md), [voice instead of touch](output/codes/voice%20instead%20of%20touch.md))

- Participant takes device to have a bath, to play relaxing music, set an alarm for the time and trying out different music as well as birds singing. ([setting a timer](output/codes/setting%20a%20timer.md), [intimacy with assistant](output/codes/intimacy%20with%20assistant.md), [bath as location](output/codes/bath%20as%20location.md), [playing nature sounds](output/codes/playing%20nature%20sounds.md))

- At one time while switching from birds to music, the music was way to loud creating a short moment of stress. Participant issues the command to put the volume to half. ([feeling stressed](output/codes/feeling%20stressed.md), [controlling the volume](controlling%20the%20volume))
