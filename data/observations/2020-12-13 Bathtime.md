## Observations
- Participant is next to device and issues the command "Hey Google, raise the volume." As the device has buttons for that, it would have been more efficient to use those. ([[issued commando]], [[voice instead of touch]])

- Participant takes device to have a bath, to play relaxing music, set an alarm for the time and trying out different music as well as birds singing. ([[setting a timer]], [[intimacy with assistant]], [[bath as location]], [[playing nature sounds]])

- At one time while switching from birds to music, the music was way to loud creating a short moment of stress. Participant issues the command to put the volume to half. ([[feeling stressed]], [[controlling the volume]])
