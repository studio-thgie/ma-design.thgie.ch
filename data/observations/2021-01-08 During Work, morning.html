        <p>09:15 Participant says, “I’m quite unsure where to put the
        device. It’s quite comfortable to use it handsfree but often
        it’s in another room, so it doesn’t hear me very well. I almost
        would love to have a device in every room!”</p>
        <p>09:45 Participant begins work routine, device is in other
        room. doing administrative tasks.</p>
        <p>09:54 Participant talks with the parrots, while they roam
        around the room in search for a little distraction</p>
        <p>10:28 Participant takes care of the parrots in the aviary,
        gets back to work and plays the news via the voice assistant.
        She controls the output from the phone, without a voice command,
        but via interface. (<a

        <p>10:32 The parrots are complaining in the adjunct room about
        the news playing. Participant lowers the volume of the speaker
        through the smartphone interface. (<a

        <p>10:47 Participant was on toilett. The radio-news stopped
        playing meanwhile. The parrots continued to make noise.
        Participant calms the parrot by providing some shades then
        continues to to issue the command “Hey Google, spiel I got you
        babe von Sonny and Chair”. The speaker plays the music.
        Participant starts to care for the plants, waterin them, as the
        music plays and sings and whistles a long a few lines. (<a

        <p>11:00 Participant half jokingly says that she believes or
        thinks that Google knows what songs she likes because it listens
        when she sings with. Because everytime she plays this particular
        songs more and more of her wellbeing (Wohlfühl) songs are
        playing. (<a

        <p>11:07 Before a smoke break, Participant turns off the music
        and issues the command “and Hey Google, play bird sounds”.</p>
        <p>11:27 Participant tries to find her smartphone and issues
        some different commands to the speaker. She first tries to call
        herself then asks “where is my phone”, but uses a slangword for
        phone that the assistant doesn’t understand. (<a
