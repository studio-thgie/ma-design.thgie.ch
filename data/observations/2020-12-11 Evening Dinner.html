        <p>Four room apartement, shortly after moving in. There are
        still boxes on the ground and many things are just temporarily
        in place. The actors are situated in the living room, sitting
        around the table gathered for dinner.</p>

        <h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="Google%20Nest%20Mini">Google Nest Mini</a> is in
        adjunct room, the door between them is open and device is
        visible. <a href="data/people/Person%20bKEfGP.html">Person
        bKEfGP</a> wants to play some music, but the device doesn’t hear
        the commands. Partner picks up device, which is attached to a
        extension cable, into the living room. It is placed on the
        armrest on a couch. The partner then tries to repeat the
        command, which was “Hey Google, play Dalida”, but there seems to
        be a technical problem.</p></li>
        <li><p>The partner as well as <a
        href="data/people/Person%20bKEfGP.html">Person bKEfGP</a> try
        repeatedly to play music but the device responds with “Je suis
        désolé, il y a un problème”. At other times, the device
        missunderstands the command, but still doesn’t work. They give
        up, slightly anoyed, and concentrate on the situation around the
        table again, eating and socialising.</p></li>
        <li><p>The sister tries again, one last time and the device
        succesfully plays music. This time David Bowie. Before issuing
        the command she said something along the line, “if it works now,
        imagine!”. A brief moment of joy breaks out. The succesful
        atempt was collectively experienced as a win. The sister and the
        partner high five each other.</p></li>
        <li><p>The people around the table, except the mother, take
        turns in changing the music every few songs now. To not disturb
        the social gathering they go very close to the voice assistant
        and speak in a low voice to issue new commands.</p></li>
