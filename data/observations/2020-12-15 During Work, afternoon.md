## Observation
(p) stands for the participant
- 13:30 Internet isn't working, a problem with the provider. The [Google Nest Mini](Google%20Nest%20Mini) doesn't work because it only knows one Wifi. I support, but even for me it's quite challenging to teach the device the new wifi, the one from the neighbours.
- 14:35 Device is working again. (p) plays a song, "I got you babe", and sets the volume to 1. (p) mentions, that this is more or less all that the assistant is used for.
- (p) is exhausted, the previous moments where chaotic with calling the support and the birds were agitated
- 14:40 (p) starts to work, the parrots are back in their cage
- 14:45 assistant continues to play random song, through Spotify. (p) move the head slightly to the beat and sings the melody of one line of the current song
- 14:50 (p) searches for an address of a place that sells christmas trees. The assistants finds two suggestions, but misspronounces a German word, Burgergemeinde, as BÃ¶rgergemeinde, which is hilarious. The assistant can't help with the following inquiry of (p) for the opening hours.
- (p) finds the needed information through a websearch on the computer, on the vendors website.

- I have a meeting and (p) asks the assistant to turn of the music. I say it's ok.
- 15:15 Spotify is playing on. (p) sings another line from a song.
- 15:30 (p) needs to leave to get the tree and issues the command, "Hey Google, Musik aus"
