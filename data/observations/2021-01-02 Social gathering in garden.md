# Social gatherin in garden
*2020-12-24*

It was early evening, the sun was setting in and there was a small social gathering for the reason of cheering for the birthday of the participant. There was a firebowl with a nice fire and the participants prepared some snacks, as well as mulled wine.

The participant took the device outside to play music.

Other people at the small gather also started to choose songs. But often, they didn't quite trust that they will be heard. They went closer to the device, to make sure their commands work. Sometimes the device also played something wrong, which was received with amusement by the group.

Some tales of voice assistants were exchanged. Like the one instance, where a user talked in English with the device, but in a german accent, and the device answered in German.
