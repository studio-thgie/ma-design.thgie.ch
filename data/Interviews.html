        assistants as assistive technologies</h2>
        <p>These two interviews were specifically conducted to follow up
        and specify details on the comparison between assistive
        technologies and voice assistants.</p>

        <p>How do Voice Assistants mediate our access to the world,
        especially within the context of inclusion design. I wanted to
        gain insights into how voice assistants and assistive
        technologies compare.</p>

        <p>These interviews were held with representatives from
        households with two or more member without regards to the
        specific assemblage. It was important that the voice assistant
        is present as a electronic device within a socio-material
        situation. I was interested to see what place and role such a
        voice assistant will inherit within these assemblages.</p>

        <h2 id="notes-on-transcripts">Notes on Transcripts</h2>
        <p>Most Interviews were held in Swiss-German dialekt as this was
        the most natural way of talking. In the transcripts I opted for
        a translation into german to enable an easier and automated
        translations into other languages. As the analysis is mostly
        interested into the semantic content of what was said, as
        opposed to how it was said, I ommited expletive words and delay
        sounds.</p>
